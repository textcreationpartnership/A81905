            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I wrote to my Friend about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with State Matters in the Pulpit, I intended onely in a plain and familiar way, to ſatisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: therefore as in a ſubject clear to my thoughts, I did not much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt the Matter and Method; but <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinante calamo</hi> and careleſly; I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, both to juſtifie mine own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and to anſwer that which is objected againſt it; thoſe truths, which I thought he would moſt readily entertain. But ſeeing you have told me your obſervation, that ſome do not acquieſce in thoſe plain conceptions, but intend to wade deeper in that Subject then I ſeem to have done; and that from ſuch, I muſt expect to be contradicted, and ſhould do well to prepare for a Controverſie. Seeing (I ſay) this intimation hath been given me, both from your ſelf at firſt;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:163962:3"/> and ſince alſo from others: I think it not amiſſe to reflect a little deeper upon this matter; that if needs there muſt be a Controverſie, it may not be a wilde one (as now adayes many are) but regulated unto edification.</p>

                  <head>The occaſion of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</head>
                  <p>For mine own part, I have made it my work hitherto, to compoſe Controverſies amongſt thoſe of my Profeſſion, ſo far as God hath given me addreſſe thereunto: therefore I have not provoked any to ſtrife; nor have I entertained any provocation given me, as others are wont to do: but my way hath been to follow Peace. Yet I am not afraid of any Controverſie; for how elſe ſhould I be able to deal with Controverters? therefore if I ſhall be drawn forth, and ſet upon in a contentious way, for ſpeaking my conſcience, when I have given no particular offence unto any, but plead onely for the juſtifying of mine own practiſe; I hope I ſhall neither want reſolution to ſtand up for righteouſneſſe; nor that in ſuch a caſe, the ſtrength which God hath given me to maintain a truth for his glory, will fail me. And as for that which (I am told) is given out by ſome concerning me, that I had a private end to gain to my ſelf preferment, by writing that Diſcourſe, in ſeeking thereby to favour a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the State. I can call to witneſſe upon my ſoul him, who ſhall one day reveal the ſecrets of all hearts, and the hidden things of darknes; that when I wrote at my friends intreatie upon that ſubject, I had no worldly ayme for my ſelf: but my whole deſigne was onely his ſpirituall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the building up of thoſe, to whom by him the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might be imparted: nor do I know, that ever I was told by any, but by your ſelf, and that after the Diſcourſe was publiſhed, and ſince by one or two more, that there was any deſigne in the State, to make an Act to regulate that matter; ſo far was I from favouring ſuch a deſigne, that I was utterly ignorant thereof; But it is naturall to men to judge of others, by that which they uſe to do themſelves. Therefore it is with me a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of men ſet in ſuch a way; nor ſhall I for this ſet my ſelf to grieve any of them, or give them occaſion of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but I ſhall take from hence rather an opportunity to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:163962:3"/> prevent a needleſſe debate, if any ſhould ſeek it, about this buſineſſe: and if a needfull one ought not to be avoided, I ſhall endevour that it may be ſo ordered, as not to increaſe any breaches, confuſions and animoſities amongſt us; but rather heal, redreſſe, and allay the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If then any ſhall think himſelf or his cauſe much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that which I have ſaid, and ſhall in the trouble of his minde, paſſionately fall either upon me, or upon my handling of that ſubject: I ſhall not at all perhaps take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him; or if I do, it ſhall onely be with meekneſſe to right the wrongful conſtructions, which haply will be made of my words and actions.</p>
                  <p>But if any ſhall with a ſober minde ſeriouſly take into conſideration the matter it ſelf, whereof I have declared my judgement; and ſhall endevour to ſhew me ſome error in my way; I ſhall heartily thank him, and fairly meeting him be very willing to conferre in a brotherly manner about that which ſhall be found doubtfull between us; that the truth, which is uſefull to edification in this matter, may be found out.</p>

                  <p>And to this effect (becauſe I am glad of any opportunity, to meet as in the preſence of Chriſt, with the ſpirit of ſtrife and bitterneſſe, to caſt it out from amongſt Chriſtians; and conjure it by the counſels of Peace and Truth, which he hath taught his diſciples) I ſhall offer ſome Rules to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, that will as a profeſſor of Chriſtianity enter into any debate, that not onely ſuperfluous and needleſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of debate (whereunto Satan lyeth in wait to draw us) may be prevented: but alſo that the things which ſhall be found forth the diſquirie, may without confuſion (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our nature is bent) be diſcuſſed underſtandingly; and in an orderly way for edification. For I will neither be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſpend my time upon trifles, and venting of private paſſions (as ſome delight to do) nor will I in a ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuffer my thoughts either to walk at random by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ſelf, or to be led up and down in a diſorderly manner, after the humor of any man whatſoever: and this courſe I take both with mine own ſpirit, and for others ſake,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:163962:4"/> cautiouſly; that within my ſelf, I may diſcover the ſnares and plots of Satan againſt me, which my corruptions might cloſe withall: and that if others will take upon them to meddle with matters of duty towards God and Men, either under a Religious or Civill reſpect; and preſuming to play the maſters (as now almoſt all do) will not enter into the liſts of Conſcience and Reaſon to walk by a Rule therein; they may be diſcovered to be Hypocrites and Fools, and conſequently unworthy of the conſcionable and rationall entertainment, which is due unto the ingenuous profeſſors of Chriſtianity and Morality.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, concerning the ſubject, whereof a Debate is offered, the main thing which I look upon therein is, the naturall worth of the matter, with the effects and accidentall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the handling thereof: that I may know whether it be <hi>operae-pretium,</hi> and that it deſerves to be handled yea or no. And that I may make a true eſtimate hereof, I uſe to conſider chiefly three things. 1. The nature and kinde of things whereunto the ſubject doth, or doth not belong. 2. The recommendation which it hath, or hath not from God unto my conſcience. 3. The ordinary or extraordinarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, which the right or wrong handling thereof may have upon the ſpirits of men, to affect them to good or evill with powerfull motions.</p>
                     <p>If then I find, that the ſubject in its nature and kind doth not belong to the ſphere of my profeſſion; that it hath no recommendation from Gods Word, either in generall or particularly, and in expreſſe terms to be layed to heart: and that it hath no powerfull influence, either upon mine own ſpirit, or upon the ſpirits of others, to affect the ſame one way or other, I uſe not to meddle with it, for I judge it not worth the handling; but if it hath any of theſe properties, or all of them, and I finde that doubts are rationally raiſed about it, I think my ſelf bound to diſcuſſe the ſame when they are offered unto me; and it is ſeaſonable ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why I think myſelf obliged to make this, or ſome ſuch like eſtimate of every ſubject, before I entertain it, is, leſt unawares I might become as one of thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle in his dayes warned <hi>Timothie,</hi> who <hi>turned aſide</hi>

                     <head>What to be conſidered about the end for which a Debate is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up.</head>
                     <p>Secondly, concerning the end, for which a Debate is to be proſecuted; I judge thus, that except I can perceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:163962:5"/> to be intended towards <hi>the uſe of edifying,</hi> whereunto we are commanded to <hi>direct all our communication,</hi> I ſhall not<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29.</note> meddle with it, but rather proteſt againſt it: and that I may not be miſtaken concerning that which is intended towards<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> the uſe of edifying, I take the meaſure of mine own and other mens aimes by two Rules: the firſt is, If either the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it ſelf is not fit to manifeſt ſome <hi>part of Gods glory:</hi> or if the aime of thoſe that handle it, is not ſet profeſſedly to ſhew forth that part of his glory which the matter offers; then I conclude, that the handling of it is not intended for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, if the matter it ſelf, is fit to be reduced to the end of the commandment, and thoſe that handle it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to advance that end by it; <hi>Which is charity out of a pure</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note>

                     <p>And the exact obſervation of theſe two Rules in reflecting upon our own ſpirit, to examine and ſet our heart aright by them, is ſo abſolutely neceſſarie, that in all matters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, wherein men pretend to knowledge, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any man to avoid the ſnares of his own naturall pride, except he can take up this courſe, to quiet and wean his ſpirit from it: for the naturall uſe of all <hi>knowledge doth puffe us up.</hi> Whence it is, that without this ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> we ſhall unavoidably fall into the condemnation of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle doth characteriſe to be <hi>proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, but doting about queſtions, and ſtrifes of words; of which cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evill ſurmiſings, perverſe diſputings:</hi> the proper works of men of <hi>corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth.</hi> From ſuch, and ſuch practiſes, he exhorts us <hi>to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our ſelves:</hi> for we ſee daily by dolefull experience, that <hi>the profane and vain</hi> bablings, whereby men ſtudy onely to<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 16.</note> pleaſe themſelves and diſcredit others, <hi>do increaſe unto more ungodlineſſe.</hi> If therefore the end of the debate ſhould not be clearly determined by the forenamed Rules, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken up in the fear of God, (<hi>ſeeing the beginning of</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, concerning the point of difference, how to ſtate the Queſtion rightly, which is to be debated, I take it to be one of the chiefeſt rationall expedients that can be uſed, to prevent the inconveniencie of an endleſſe controverſie: nor is there any one thing that doth more intangle and increaſe the multiplicitie of needleſſe Debates, then the miſtake of the point of difference either wilfully or ignorantly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. By this means Satan doth inable and ingagemens ſpirits to make their conteſtations inextricable, endleſſe, and irreconcileable: for when the Queſtion is not diſtinctly ſtated, and men are entred as it were blindfold upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, they will rather ſhift the point of debate twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie times, then ſeem to be found in an error once; and will rather ſhew a willingneſſe to diſſent in every thing, then have any thing determined by their adverſarie, as a Truth againſt them. And becauſe in the ordinarie Debates we ſee, that men labour to ſtate the Queſtion onely as they pleaſe, which commonly is to the prejudice (although it be clearly againſt the ſenſe) of their antagoniſt; it is evident hereby, that they are led by Satan to affect rather this, that their adverſary may be thought guilty of hainous errors and practiſes; then to endevour this, that his true meaning may be diſcuſſed, and thereby ſome profitable truth, and rule of practiſe held forth unto all: and from theſe roots of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it is, that almoſt all the books of Modern Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, are ſtuffed throughout with clamors, railings, injuries, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>How it is to be ſtated.</head>
                     <p>Therefore to prevent the miſtakes which lead men into ſuch diſtempers; the firſt occaſion thereof is to be avoided, which is an inclination to be partiall for our ſelves, to get ſome advantage by framing of the Queſtion. But to avoid this ſnare, the true knot and center of the difference ought to be propoſed as a doubtfull Queſtion, and not as an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or a charge; that is to ſay, the thing to be debated is to be layed down, in the name of both parties, as they ſhall agree to underſtand it; and not as any one of them would have it underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Therfore I do offer to walk by theſe Rules in this matter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, let a Queſtion be framed by him that will enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Debate, expreſſing that which he conceiveth to be the matter of doubt between him and his antagoniſt to be decided.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let the Queſtion be opened, and all the parts and terms thereof explained, to ſhew in what ſenſe every word is taken, by him that offereth it unto the Debate.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let that be ſhewed, wherein he conceiveth there is an agreement between himſelf, and the party with whom he is to debate.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, let the preciſe point of difference be diſtinctly declared, as a doubt to be reſolved.</p>
                     <p>And when this is done, let the Queſtion thus ſtated (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any arguing <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> be entertained about it) be imparted to the party with whom the Debate is intended; that he may declare his ſenſe thereof, whether yea or no, the point of difference in his minde doth lye there where the other hath placed it. For if it doth not, and I ſhould have entred upon the Debate before this is known, all my labour would be loſt, and in vain as to him: becauſe he will neither deny what I intend to prove, nor affirm what I refute; but ſomething elſe perhaps which I have not at all mentioned, or thought upon.</p>

                     <head>What to be done to handle the Queſtion ſtated, ſo as to come to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly debate thereof.</head>
                     <p>Fourthly, the way of handling the point of doubt, to find e a deciſion thereof, ought to be predetermined before
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:163962:6"/> the Debate be undertaken: and to this effect when ever I ſhall intend to enter upon a Debate with any body, I ſhall proceed with him after this Method.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall write unto him as a Brother, letting him know the offence which his Doctrine or Practiſe doth give; and how prejudiciall it is to the Goſpel in publick. Here I ſhall ſtate the Queſtion between me and him as I ſhall underſtand it, deſiring him to rectifie my thoughts concerning his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or practiſes, if I miſtake either of them: and if I miſtake them not, to give me leave for his own and the publick good to endevour the rectifying of that wherein I ſhall conceive him to be out of the way.</p>
                     <p>This entrie is to be made upon the buſineſſe both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to Chriſts rule, by which ſcandals are to be taken away from amongſt brethren: <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. And alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſarie to prevent prejudicate affections, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get love, to try the ingenuity of our Brother; and to waken the ſincerity which ought to be in him, to walk anſwerable to the rules of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>If upon this offer he doth give a fair Anſwer, he will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate the Queſtion otherwiſe then I did to rectifie my miſtake, and ſo perhaps decline the Debate: or by altring the Queſtion he will give a new riſe to deal further with him; or by allowing that ſtate which I have propoſed, he will accept of a conference thereupon.</p>
                     <p>But if he doth give no fair Anſwer, or no Anſwer at all, to that which is offered; then I ſhall give him a ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and acquaint ſome friends with it to joyn with me, to make him ſenſible of his duty by two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, according to Chriſts rule in this caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. And if this ſecond admonition doth not draw him on, to any effect of Chriſtian ingenuity, the whole narrative and proces of the buſines may be offered to the Society of thoſe under whom he doth ſtand, that by them he may be dealt withall according to Chriſts direction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. if they bring him to the ſenſe of his duty, well and good: if not, he is to be left unto himſelf as an Heathen and a Publicane, whom the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to reſtrain from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:163962:7"/> wilfulneſſe, and offenſive irregularity.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing him to be ingenuous, and willing to juſtifie unto me that which I think to be a miſſe in him, a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will be accepted, either by word of mouth, or in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or both wayes joyntly; for both wayes may concur at once. Then,</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I ſhal make an offer of the Principles, from whence I ſhall conceive the deciſion of the doubt ſhould be taken: and of the orderly way of applying thoſe Principles, that by conſequences drawn from them, the point of doubt raiſed between us may be determined. If we agree upon the Principles, and upon the orderly way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thereupon concluſions applyable to the doubt in hand; then we ſhall proceed affirmatively, and negatively, to ſeek out the determination of the point. But if we agree not upon the Principles at firſt propoſed, neither can we agree upon the way of applying the ſame to any thing in hand. Therefore we muſt riſe higher, and propoſe other Principles which are more common and remote, wherein a full agreement may be found; and then alſo the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thereupon, to regulate the application of truths follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence to decide the point of doubt, is to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; which being done, nothing remaineth but to come to the Debate it ſelf.</p>

For this is the anointing which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">The benefit and effect of the obſervation thereof.</note> the true diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt all things, and leads them in all orderly wayes of knowledge, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, of charitie, meekneſſe, and ſobriety within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and towards all men: for he that hath not attained to the obſervation and demonſtration of theſe wayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, and to the exerciſing of his own ſpirit thereunto, by and from the example of Chriſt, can never exerciſe them effectually towards other men.</p>
                  <p>Therfore if a Chriſtian that can look into his own heart, will as in the preſence of God reflect upon his buſineſſe, and before he undertakes a controverſie, firſt conſider &amp; diſcern the matter offered, whether yea or no, it doth belong to him to meddle with it; and if he finds himſelf obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, if then he will ſettle his purpoſes within himſelf (in reference to the aime which Chriſt teacheth, and the means of proſecuting the ſame ſutable to Chriſts rules:) and laſtly if he will look upon his neighbour, with whom he hath to deal, with ſuch an eye as Chriſt (if he were in the fleſh) or the Apoſtle <hi>Paul (becoming all things to all men</hi>) would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9 19. 24.</note> him: if (I ſay) he will thus conſider his buſineſſe at the firſt entrie thereupon, lifting up his ſpirit unto God, for help and direction to order his wayes aright; he ſhall not want light to diſcover, and power to caſt off all the ſnares of Satan, which may take hold of him in his way: for it is onely for want of this fore-caſt within our ſelves, for want of orderly carriage in reſpect of the buſineſſe, and for want of ingenuitie, and of humilitie towards our neighbour, (which things are no where taught but in the ſchool of true<note place="margin">The inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of the want thereof.</note> Chriſtianity) that all our Debates are become meer hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; all our diſtractions meer confuſions; all our doubts

                  <head>Concerning the Rules of Arguing in a Debate.</head>
                  <p>And to this effect, to regulate the Debate it ſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of doubtfull matters, I ſhall offer foure other Rules which relate to the point of arguing, that it may be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and without offence.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, concerning arguments to be taken from the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, concerning arguments to be taken from Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The third, concerning arguments to be taken from the words of men.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, concerning arguments to be taken from humane actions.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing our Debates with conſcionable and rationall men, ſhould tend onely to rectifie their thoughts and wayes in things pertaining to their duty towards God and men; nor is there any other way to do this effectually and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, but by argument to convince their conſcience and reaſon of that which they owe unto God and men: therfore I conceive, that none other arguments are to be uſed, but ſuch as are directly convincing, that is, binding of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Reaſon over, to a belief of that which they offer: nor are they to be uſed in any other way, then ſuch, as may make that belief moſt readie, moſt free, moſt full, and moſt conſtant: and if we can ſo regulate the way of arguing both for the matter offered, and the manner of propoſing the ſame, that nothing ſhall be diſproportionate or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to theſe aimes: I ſuppoſe, we ſhall gain the purpoſe for which all Debates are to be entertained, which is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of a truth by the deciſion of that which was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For when this is done fully, as to the matter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:163962:9"/> as to the manner, then all that man can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall in, is done; the reſt of the work, which is to cauſe that truth to be received in love for the converſion of the ſoul, is Gods own immediate work, and not mans: for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane debates may reach to the conviction of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but not to a converſion of the heart; as we ſee in Chriſt himſelf, who oft-times convicted the Jews of a truth, but they were not alwayes converted to the love thereof by his Doctrine.</p>

                           <item n="1">1. In things determinable by Scripture authority, I ſhall neither alledge, nor admit of the allegation of any other Authority.</item>
                           <item n="2">2. In places of Scripture, whereof the meaning ſhall be doubtfull, to finde out the interpretation thereof, I ſhall proceed not conjecturally, nor traditionally, nor by any pretended private inſpiration, (which is but imagination, and commonly proves a deluſion) but rationally obſerving theſe Rules.</item>
                           <item n="1">1. In caſe the proper, that is, the ordinary grammaticall ſenſe of the words, is not repugnant to the undoubted Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the common Faith, or the clear Analyſis and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Context; I ſhall neither give nor receive any other ſenſe but that which is proper and grammaticall.</item>
                           <item n="2">2. But in caſe the proper and ordinary grammaticall ſenſe of the words is repugnant either to the Analogie of Faith, or the clear Analyſis of the text, then they muſt be taken in another ſenſe, either figurative or ſpirituall, which is moſt agreeable to both.</item>

                              <pb n="15" facs="tcp:163962:9"/>3. By the Analyſis of the Context, I underſtand a right dividing of the whole Diſcourſe into its periods, according<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15.</note> to the ſeverall parts of the matter contained therein; of the periods into their ſentences; and of the ſentences into their ſingle propoſitions by their proper joynts and articles.</item>
                           <item n="4">4. The Analyſis or Diviſion of every Context may not be contradicted, if it is not diſproportionate to the Generall Analogie of the Common Faith.</item>
                           <item n="5">5. Nor is any Prophecie, that is, propoſall of Doctrines,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21</note> Exhortations, and Comforts otherwiſe to be admitted, but as it is Analogicall, that is, proportionate to the principles<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 5.</note> of the common Faith, and the undeniable conſequences of truth following thereupon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6.</item>
                           <item n="6">6.

                           <item n="2">2. I allow nothing to be ſound Reaſon in Diuinitie, but that which is proportionate to the common principles of revealed truth in the Scriptures.</item>
                           <item n="3">3. I ſhall therefore oblige no man to beleeve any thing to be a Divine truth; but that onely, which from common ſcripturall principles is demonſtrable.</item>
                           <item n="4">4. I conceive, all revealed truths to be rationally uttered, and nothing irrationally expreſſed in the Word of God; and therefore a moſt fit object for the rationall facultie of man to be employed in.</item>

In matters of Humane diſquiſition, that is, which may be underſtood without any ſpeciall revelation; I ſhall not admit that any thing ſhould be determined by cuſtome, or humane authority, which is determinable by a true reaſon to be found in the nature of the thing it ſelf.</item>
                           <item n="7">7.

                           <item n="2">2. In matters of fact, where none other proof of a truth can be had, but the teſtimony of man, it ſhall be preſſed no further, then it is found probable, and not lyable to any credible exception.</item>
                           <item n="3">3. The ſayings of other men in matters of Doctrine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther few or many joyned in opinion, ſhall be taken for no proofs further then their reaſons are found valid; or then he to whom they are alledged, hath declared his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; for then they are to be conſidered as his own.</item>

                           <item n="5">5.

                           <item n="2">2. No failings ſhall be aggravated to the worſt ſenſe though they bee manifeſt, but I ſhall bee willing to excuſe them ſo farre as probably they may bear a good conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without doing wrong to truth and righteouſneſſe.</item>
                           <item n="3">3. I ſhall not interpret any mans intention to have been otherwiſe in his actions, then hee ſhall declare it to have been: nor ſhall I charge faults otherwiſe upon him, then as Hypothetically gathered from cleere circumſtances; which ſhall be noted rather to give warning, and admoniſh him to take heed, leſt a root of bitterneſſe might be found in them; then to make them a poſitive charge againſt him, or the poiſon thereof his guiltineſſe.</item>
                           <item n="4">4. No matters of meer ſuſpition or hear-ſay ſhall bee further named; then to cleer my ſelf from the guilt of the wrong that may bee in them: But of things cleerly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or openly known to all; that which their properties manifeſtly utter, as contrary to the undoubted profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſhall with meekneſſe and zeale be opened; that he who is guilty thereof may be pulled out of the fire, and made ſenſible of the dangerous unevenneſſe of his way; that he may recover himſelf from the ſnares wherein Satan hath caught him. And thus I ſhall alſo deſire to be dealt withall by thoſe, who ſhall have occaſion to obſerve my actions to redreiſe that which may be found amiſſe in them.</item>

                  <p>Now if any of theſe Rules ſhall bee excepted againſt by any; and ſhewed to bee prejudiciall to the diſcoverie of truth; or all of them together inſufficient to the finding of a reſolution in lawfull doubts; or defective to lead us by a profitable debate in the way of Truth, Peace, Love, and Righteouſneſſe; I ſhall be willing to adde, and alter, and upon conviction receive better directions from others, if offered. But if thoſe who intend to deale with me, upon the Subject which hath occaſioned this diſcourſe: ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nothing againſt theſe Rules; and yet not obſerve them in their dealing with me: I may haply, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, bee able to let them ſee the injuſtice of that manner of proceeding; and the grounds of that naturall corruption whence it proceedeth: which we by yeelding unto have fomented; and by exerciſing have increaſed amongſt our ſelves; which hath made all this ſpirituall diſorderlineſſe to break in, as a flood upon us; and which will infallibly become our utter ruine, if wee perſevere therein.

For that none of our Modern controverters will bee forward to enter into theſe regular courſes, whereby debates are made void of offence; may be eaſily gathered from hence; that no Spirits unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a yoke, will be willing to take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now we finde two ſorts of men (to whom all others may be reduced, as partaking more or leſſe of their Principles and wayes) who are accuſtomed to judge and debate of matters in theſe our times, who being unacquainted with this yoke, intangle affairs by different wayes of proceeding into diſorders of a contrary nature.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:163962:11"/>
               <p>The one ſort is full of confidence, relying onely upon themſelves in the high conceit of their ſingular opinions. The other look more to the conſent of a combination in the declaration of their joint opinions.</p>
               <p>The firſt think themſelves ſtrong, becauſe they pretend wholly to the direction of the Spirit in their way. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, although they contradict not the truth, of the Spirits direction promiſed to the children of God, (as ſome others do) yet they put their ſtrength rather in a humane then in a Spirituall way of acting. But the truth indeed is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other in matters of debate, hold forth to any, or follow themſelves, either in Theoreticall or Practicall debates, any approved Rules, by which they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves to edification about the diviſion of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or rationall doubts; and although this is truly ſaid of both theſe controverters; yet it cannot be denyed, but that the ſecond ſort of theſe for the moſt part is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of entertaining rules, when offered, then the firſt: becauſe many of the former take up, under the pretence of a ſpirituall liberty, the principles of ſuch unrulineſſe both within themſelves and towards others, that it is almoſt impoſſible to fix them to any thing; whereas the latter are rather too much inclined to fixe upon inſufficient rules, and humane reaſonings: but yet in both, this is evident, that whenſoever either of them ſet themſelves to conteſt for any ſuppoſed truth, or againſt any error; they follow for the moſt part nothing ſo much, as the flaſhes of witt, or the motions of paſſion whiles they rely upon the ſtrength of their naturall and acquired abilities: for the one, viz: the firſt, are led chiefly by their naturall; the other by their acquired notions.</p>
               <p>Theſe that walke in the ſtrength of their naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,<note place="margin">The firſt ſort of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</note> which they raiſe to ſome extravagant height by the apprehenſion of ſpirituall objects; uſe to confound all things under the ſpeciall notions, which they have pitched upon; and without any diſtinction of matters, as ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall from naturall; of humane from divine, of inward from outward, or even of God himſelf from the creatures,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:163962:12"/> they caſt all things into ſome imaginary frame of their owne moulding, wherewith they are ſo prepoſſeſſed; that they can conceive of nothing elſe, but that which is wreſted and made conſonant to the thoughts, wherewith they have racked their own underſtandings out of frame. With theſe men (if once high flowen) there can be no rationall deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for they have crackt their brain, and deſpiſe all things as below themſelves: Magiſtracy, Miniſtery, Ordinances, Scriptures, nay and Chriſt himſelf, is by ſome made a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſmall or no concernment at all, in reſpect of that which they account themſelves to have attained unto.</p>
               <p>From theſe and ſuch as joyne neereſt in Principles with theſe, none other controverſie (as I conceive) can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,<note place="margin">What contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is to be expected from them.</note> but that which theſe two queſtions do offer: as firſt, whether <hi>yea or no the Chriſtian Magiſtrate hath any thing to do at all, with the viſible affaires of the Churches?</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yea or no the Rule and Government of all things doth not belong properly unto the Saints, and to none but them?</hi> Whom they meane by Saints, and what by rule and government, is not now time to enquire after; but it is apparent, that their Principles and thoughts lead them rather to lay aſide all Rule, and all Magiſtracy, at leaſt in reference to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saints; then to think that they ought to be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing. But by reaſon of the extravagancies whereunto ſome have licentiated themſelves, and of the ſtrange pretenſions which are made to a Fantaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereof none other account can bee given, but their owne bare ſaying of themſelves, that it is ſo and ſo with them: (I ſay) by reaſon of this and their other impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; theſe men have not only made themſelves a grievance unto the Godly, and a laughing ſtocke unto others, that are morally ſober and rationall; but for their ſake the mouthes of the profane in the world are opened againſt Religion, Atheiſts are confirmed in their impietie; a diſreſpect and ſcandall is raiſed againſt the ſpirituall profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity amongſt ſingle hearted formaliſts: and the politick adverſaries of our ſettlement and Reformation triumph and exult at it over us.</p>

               <p>Now as I do not expect, that any of theſe who make themſelves ſo eminent in their ſpiritualitie, as to have caſt off all moralitie, ſhould debate this matter: ſo nothing which from their Principles can be drawn, is to be much regarded. But ſuch as are not ſtrangers to a life truly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, although they are not found to walk up to it; but rather follow the way of humane reaſonings, ſuch as have<note place="margin">The ſecond ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverters who are men of Reaſon and Learning.</note> improved their naturall with acquired abilities, of ſciences and experience by ſtudie, and converſation: and ſuch as have intereſſed themſelves hitherto in State affairs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtrumentall for the deſignes of one, or againſt the proceedings of another party; ſuch (I ſay) as theſe may perhaps ſpeak ſomething to the purpoſe, worth conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deſerving an Anſwer; chiefly if without prejudice and paſſion, and with due reſpect unto conſcience and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they weigh the matter, whereof they ſhall offer a debate diſcreetly.</p>
               <p>With theſe I ſhall not be unwilling to go along to ſearch out a doubtfull truth in this or any other matter. Onely before I come to ſpeak of this particular ſubject, to ſhew what I conceive the debate may be with theſe, according to the forenamed Rules; I ſhall in two or three words, briefly intreat, by way of warning, the cauſes of diſorderlineſſe whereunto our ordinary courſe is acceſſory to intangle our affairs.</p>
               <p>If we reflect then upon our wayes, wee may obſerve that the aime of ordinary controverters is ſet rather to uphold<note place="margin">What way of controverting is uſed by moſt of them.</note> (and that profeſſedly) the outward intereſt of a party; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vindicate it from ſome aſperſion, or to gaine ſome advantage to the proceedings thereof; by aſperſing others, and by getting themſelves into power over others; then to make a diſcoverie of profitable duties, and of naked Truths, that the neceſſitie of the former, and the evidence of the latter, may become recommendable indifferently unto the conſciences of all men: or that the conſcience of thoſe who have ſtrayed from the ſame may bee brought backe againe unto the acknowledgement thereof, whence alſo we ſee, that the courſe taken to debate differences, even in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:163962:13"/> ſpirituall matters, and farre more in outward concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth almoſt ſavour nothing elſe; but the affectation of naturall wiſdome, of ſubtilty, and of eloquence, and the venting of paſſions proper to men depending upon this world. And herein wee finde a pride moving men to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip one another, either by ſhewing their parts; as wit, language, reading, Philoſophy, Hiſtory, and other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or by laſhing and ſmiting one another with the tongue: to ſeek a conqueſt rather by the infamy of others, then by the armour of righteouſneſſe on the right hand, and on the left. By theſe unchriſtian and unconſcionable wayes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering matters, and dealing with perſons, the more able, and naturally rationall the men are that take them up, the more deſtructive they make themſelves unto the comforts of their brethren; and the neerer their Debates thus agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted relate unto Religion, the further off they ſet themſelves and others from the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: the reſpect which is had to gain credit with men, to looſe no ground in the Debate, and to be thought a leader in the cauſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the fear, leſt we ſhould ſeem to be foiled in any thing; chiefly after we have owned the title of a Doctor of Divinity, and think our ſelves in ſome repute for Learning; doth ſtrip us of all Chriſtian ſimplicitie, and morall inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie: for when we come to a cloſe fight, and in danger to be convicted of ſome error, our paſſions are inflamed, and we chooſe rather, to make our conteſtations endleſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable, then that our Antagoniſt ſhould ſeem to have gotten any advantage againſt us. Thus we ſtrive not for Truth and Righteouſneſſe, how to finde it out (for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall way to ſeek it, is not once thought upon) but for our ſelves in compariſon to others, that we, and we onely may be thought to have it; and this makes the Debates te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, full of trifling circumſtances, and ſo large and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous; that to read onely the heads of matters agitated in this way, will require more time, then a wiſe man will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thereunto, or a godly man can take pleaſure to ſpend thereupon.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe rocks of contentiouſneſſe and irregularitie,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:163962:13"/> the excellent gifts of many able (and otherwiſe godly) men, are oft-times ſhipwrackt. For Satan by their zeal for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">The evill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this way.</note> and privat ends, hath blinded them in that which is truly publick; and by this meanes (for it is from the failings of godly men on all ſides, that our miſery doth chiefly ariſe) a fire is kindled amongſt us of prejudicacy and jealouſie, which never will be quenched by humane power, or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: only God is able to put forth his hand in ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way to lead us in a path which yet we have not known, a path which godly men will be capable to diſcern from his word, wherein it is revealed; and which by his Spirit will be<note place="margin">The hope of a remedy to be found in it.

For the promiſes upon which I raiſe this hope, are large &amp; plain, and oft-times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For it is ſaid, not only that he <hi>will make a way in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi> (where no path is) <hi>and give ſtreams of waters</hi> (that is, comfortable refreſhments) in the deſerts; but that he will <hi>make the wilderneſſe of his Sion</hi> (his Church) <hi>and her waſte places, like unto Eden, and her Deſert like the Garden of the Lord.</hi> The failings therefore, and humane frailties of the people that ſeeke him in truth, ſhall not bring upon them a perpetuall deſolation; as the back-ſliding of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall doe unto hypocrites: but when their <hi>wilderneſſe is</hi>

               <p>To come then to a more ſpeciall application of all this, to the point in hand; I ſay, If a debate concerning my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (<hi>That Miniſters ought not to meddle with State-matters in their Pulpits,</hi>) ſhall be offered by any, with a deſire to dig deeper than I have done, and goe to the root of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I ſhall not wave a conference with them: onely I ſhall deſire that it may be agitated according to the Rules which I have mentioned, or by ſome others, if better can be ſhewed to edification: Therefore in conformity to what, hath been ſaid heretofore, I ſhall offer the queſtion to bee ſtated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The generall queſtion, or ſubject of debate.</head>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To finde out what the Rules of Love, of Righteouſneſſe, and of Peace are, which at all times are obſervable mutually, between the Miniſters of Chriſt, and their Chriſtian Magiſtrates, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective diſcharge of their duties towards the people over whom they are ſet.</hi>

                  <head>The end for which it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and what the uſefulneſſe thereof is.</head>
                  <p>For ſeeing the Magiſtracy and the Miniſtery are the two great and Maſter-wheeles, of all the publick States of the Chriſtian world; therefore we ſee, that by the motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if regular upon their own Axle-trees, and duly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one with the other, all the affaires of humane ſocieties are carried on ſucceſsfully, for the attainment of their eternall and temporall felicity, both towards God and men: But if their motions be either irregular within themſelves, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with each other, it is evident in all Ages, that from thence the affaires of all ſocieties, become unſucceſsfull, and tend onely to the miſery and deſolation of mankind. If then it be, (as no doubt it is) expedient for us, to diſcuſſe at this time, that ſubject, wherein both theſe are at once concerned; to cleare our doubts therein, that we may know what is juſt, lawfull and commendable in the behaviour of the one towards the other; and if we ſhould intend to do this ſatisfactorily; it wil be requiſite that we ſhould make a true diſcovery of the generall nature of the duties belonging to both their places, as well in the reſpect of the mutuall relations, as in reſpect of the outward actions of their charges; which lead them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to the true ends of all their motions. For by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diſcovery we ſhall finde grounds to come to the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any queſtion in particular, what ever it may be, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereon (for with other queſtions we have nothing to doe) but if we take not the light which from thence may be gathered, along with us, our thoughts in every thing will be full of darkneſſe; nor ſhall we find any path to walk in, made plain before us.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore, that this aim to ſeek out theſe Rules, is to be taken up in this debate, not onely that we may know what is neceſſary foredification in the main works of both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; and that we may find a directory thereby, leading us towards the reſolution of our preſent doubt, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:163962:15"/> is wrapt up in the ignorance of thoſe fundamentals; but alſo that we may circumſcribe and determine our thoughts in the debate it ſelfe, leſt they miſcarry, and be ſuffered to wander upon uſe leſſe and by-matters, uncertainly, as it happeneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others in the debates of this and of ſome other kinds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I declare before-hand, that my reſolution is unalterably to wave every thing which ſhall be offered, that hath no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or collaterall tendency and ſubordination towards the diſcovery of theſe Rules: for to finde out a cleare demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the truth of theſe, is the whole fruit of all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>

                  <head>The termes of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</head>
                  <p>Thus having determined the end of the debate, let us come to look upon the point of difference which may be between us: And here I cannot definitly ſay wherein others differ from me in a poſitive opinion (I ſee what the poſitive diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their practice is from mine, but men oft-times doe more then they think they doe) but that they who allow at large (which I do not) Miniſters to meddle in matters of State, may judge wherein I doe differ from them; I ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the method formerly ſet down, and firſt open my ſenſe of the queſtion, and then declare both the agreement and the difference which I conceive to be therein between us.</p>
                  <p>The termes of the queſtion I underſtand thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Miniſters of the Goſpel of Chriſt, I underſtand certain men who (take not upon them at their own hand; but) are called in an ordinary and orderly way to teach other men the knowledge of Chriſt, to perſwade and exhort them to receive him, and walk in him by faith and love, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own ſoules, and the enlargement of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome towards others in the world, to pray for and with them, and to overſee their wayes, that they may be found conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their profeſſion. And this I conceive is the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their imployment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Goſpel of Chriſt I underſtand the glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Gods free Grace offered to us in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with mankind in Chriſt, that we may entertain it by faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the Sermons of thoſe Miniſters teaching this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:163962:15"/> I meane their ordinary ſpeeches to their hearers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject, by which they ought to bring them to the obedience of faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 By the Magiſtrates I underſtand certain men whom God hath exalted, and ſet over the viſible Societies of men for their good; to over-ſee their wayes, and order them in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by power and authority to make them conformable unto his known will.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By State-affaires, which are ſaid to be the employments of the Magiſtrate, I mean all things which concerne either the viſible ſocieties, or the ſingle perſons of men, as relating to their outward ſtate and condition of life in the world, wherein power and authority can be exerciſed for the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By Power I mean the forcible meanes of conſtraining through feare, thoſe that are in ſubjection, to doe that which their ſuperiors will have them to do. This is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Sword, Rom.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By Authority I meane a right to adminiſter a charge, and to beare rule therein over others for the government of their wayes; whereunto thoſe that are to be governed, owe reſpect and ſubmiſſion: And this is that which the Apoſtle calls to <hi>be ſubject for conſcience ſake, Rom.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the things whereof the queſtion doth ſpeak; but</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The thing queſtioned, or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doubt.</head>
                  <p>The queſtion it ſelfe, or the thing queſtioned concerning theſe things is this, Whether yea or no it doth appertain to the calling and charge of thoſe that are employed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt for ſpirituall matters; when they are about that ſervice, to utter in publick their particular thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning worldly matters, which appertain to the calling and charge of thoſe who are ſet in power and authority over the Common-wealth?</p>
                  <p>To this queſtion whether we ſhould ſay abſolutely <hi>Yea,</hi> or abſolutly <hi>No,;</hi> or in ſome reſpect <hi>yea,</hi> and in ſome reſpect <hi>no,</hi> and how farre <hi>yea</hi> and how farre <hi>no,</hi> in each reſpect; is the matter of doubt, which by a friendly conference and debate, fitted to ſearch after hidden Truths, may be reſolved. And that we may endeavour this ſo, as to bring the matter to an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:163962:16"/> iſſue, without diſtractedneſſe or confuſion, let us firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that wherein we agree, as a known and determined truth; then view that which remaineth yet unknown, as an undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined doubt, that by the help of ſome principles, and the right application thereof unto the point of difference, we may make a way for our underſtanding to determine the ſame.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The matters of agreement</head>
                  <p>The matters wherein I ſuppoſe an agreement will be found, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>1. That the terms of the queſtion as they have been ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are truths, <hi>viz.</hi> That by Miniſters and Magiſtrates, and their employments; ſuch men, ſuch things, and ſuch actions are to be underſtood, as were deſcribed in the opening of the queſtion: and that the point of doubt in generall doth lie there, where it is ſaid to lie: For if either theſe termes, or any of them, be otherwiſe underſtood, or the point of doubt otherwiſe placed than hath been now mentioned; although in words we may ſeem to agree upon the ſtating of the queſtion, yet the thing it ſelfe is not agreed upon: therefore this muſt needs be preſuppoſed to be ſo, before we can proceed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other points of agreement; and then I ſhall offer this further.</p>
                  <p>2. That Ieſus Chriſt who is now at the right hand of God, having all power in heaven and earth, hath ordained in this world, both theſe kinds of Officers, ſome to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell unto men, as Miniſters of his Word and Myſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. and chap. 4. 1. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. and ſome to rule the Societies of men, to keep them in good order, as Magiſtrates endued with power to puniſh the evill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the good. <hi>Rom. 13. verſ. 1. till</hi> 8. and 1 <hi>Pet. 2. verſ. 13. till</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>3. That the employments of theſe two Officers although they are coexiſtent under Chriſt, towards the ſame men who are to be governed by them, and concurrent towards them, for his ends upon them; yet they are diſtinguiſhable the one from the other, chiefly in reſpect of their different objects, of their different immediate ends, of their different fundamentall rights to their charges, and the properties thereof, and of their different wayes of adminiſtring their charges.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:163962:16"/>
                  <p>4. That the object of the Miniſteriall adminiſtration is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the truth and will of God in the Goſpel, as it is revealed in the Scriptures; and that the object of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtraticall adminiſtration, is the Truth and Will of God, as in the Principles of right Reaſon, and the Law of Nature it is revealed.</p>
                  <p>5. That the immediate end of the Miniſteriall adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their object, is to bring mens ſoules to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in Chriſt by his ſpirit; and that the immediate end of the Magiſtraticall adminiſtration of their object, is to bring men in ſoule and body to live together in the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enjoyment of all good things, honeſtly, peaceably, and ſafely one with another.</p>
                  <p>6 That the fundamentall right unto a Miniſteriall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is to be called thereunto as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. And that the fundamentall right unto a Magiſtratical admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is to be in the place of power, and obliged to look to others, and ſee right done among them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. 14. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 23, 24. 25.</p>
                  <p>7. That the properties of the Miniſteriall right unto the adminiſtration of their object in their charges, are chiefly two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, their due qualifications for their employment, and their lawfull entry upon the charge of ſouls committed unto them. Their qualification for their employment muſt be ſuch as the Apoſtle doth require it to be, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. v. 1. till</hi> 8. and <hi>Tit. 1. v. 6. till</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>And their entry upon the charge of ſouls committed unto them, muſt be ſuch as Chriſt doth require it to be, <hi>John 10, v.</hi> 1, 2, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>8. That the properties of the Magiſtraticall right unto the adminiſtration of their object in their charges, are chiefly a threefold preeminencie, <hi>viz.</hi> a preeminencie over the perſons of all men, that all ſoules muſt be ſubject unto the higher powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. v. 1. A preeminency over the might and ſtrength of all men, that none may reſiſt the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. and a preeminencie over the goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of all men, that every one is bound to pay them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and taxes, Rom. 13. 6.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:163962:17"/>
                  <p>9. That the wayes of the miniſterial adminiſtration of their Charge, are mainly three and no more, <hi>Inſtructive, Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> and <hi>Declarative. Inſtructive</hi> to work upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that which is rational to manifeſt truth unto it. <hi>Perſuaſive</hi> to work upon the will and affections, by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties promiſes and threatnings, the ſence of good and evill, to cauſe it imbrace the one, and fly from the other. <hi>Declarative</hi> to denounce in Gods name from his undoubted word his expres will, to move the Conſcience to yield obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that is either to be comforted, or to be afflicted, as the Kingdom of Heaven is either opened or ſhut upon it, by the declared will of God towards it.</p>
                  <p>10. That the wayes of the Magiſtratical Adminiſtration of their Charge are <hi>Directive, Legiſlative,</hi> and <hi>Coercive,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wayes of their Subjects in righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Directive,</hi> by Councel and Inſtructions to ſet ſubordinate Officers a work towards their Subjects, to lead them unto the performance of their duties, and prevent diſorders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> by Lawes and Ordinances, to let all men know the juſt duties which are to be obſerved towards all men, in all caſes, relating the ſafety of the ſociety, and the indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every one belonging thereunto, from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coercive,</hi> to right all things that are amiſſe, by diſtributing rewards and puniſhments to every one as they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                  <p>11. That this Magiſtratical function may be in a Heathen man for the good of a Common-wealth; and although it may be in the hands of ſuch a man, or men, that Chriſtian Miniſters and Profeſſors, ought nevertheles to acknowledge him or them, in the place to be their lawful Magiſtrates, to reſpect them, to pray for them, and to ſubmit themſelves unto them, either actively or paſſively, as their Commands ſhall be conſiſtent with a good Conſcience under the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have offered that wherein I ſuppoſe an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be found in reſpect of the coexiſtence and diſtircti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the employments: now I ſhall go a ſtep further, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:163962:17"/> offer that alſo wherein I ſuppoſe we ſhall agree, in reſpect of the concurrence of the employments under Chriſt for his ends upon Mankind; here then I ſuppoſe it will be granted.</p>
                  <p>12. That it is as lawful for a Chriſtian man to be a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as it is expedient for him to be rational, and neceſſary to be a true ſociable man by nature; for as the profeſſion of Chriſtianity doth neither make void the uſe of reaſon, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the true life of nature; but ſanctifies the one and the other and exalts both to an uſe wherein God is glorified by them: ſo the rules of Government in a ſociable life, and the rational principle of good order in nature, are no wayes caſt off, or neglected by the Rules of Chriſtianity, but exalted and made ſubſervient to the higheſt way of happines.</p>
                  <p>13. That in a whole ſociety of men every thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to be allowed, which in one man cannot be disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: as therefore the life of right reaſon, and true nature are not inconſiſtent in one ſingle man, but concurrent with Chriſtianity to make him truly happy; ſo in a ſociety of men, to become a State, and to be governed by Magiſtrates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of reaſon, and the principles of good order in nature, is no wayes inconſiſtent, but wholly concurrent with the frame and life of a Chriſtian ſociety; although Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity abſtractively in it ſelf, is nothing elſe, but the Rule of a ſpiritual life, whereby we are directed to follow Chriſts foot-ſteps, that we may come to God by him, as new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeparate from the world.</p>
                  <p>14. That a Chriſtian being a Magiſtrate in a Chriſtian State, although all his Subjects in reſpect of Chriſt, and the way of the heavenly profeſſion; are his Brethren, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his equals; yet by this, he doth looſe nothing of the natural right and properties of this place, which God hath given to a very Heathen over Chriſtians; but gaineth rather thereby an enlargement of his preeminency, and an additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right and gracious priviledge to his place, which is at leaſt threefold <hi>Firſt,</hi> the right to be more beloved and honoured than if he were a meer Heathen. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the priviledge to become a nurſing Father to the Church of God; to provide
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:163962:18"/> for it all things outwardly comfortable, and to protect it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the preeminencie of being Chriſts <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> in the outward frame of the ſociety, by which meanes, he hath an influence to ſee things ordered according to his known will in the Common-wealth, and to ſway things to the beſt frame in the publique profeſſion, for the body of the ſociety; and an obligation laid upon him; not to ſee and ſuffer Chriſts name to be diſhonoured; and his Ordinances blaſphamed: ſo farre as by his place he can hinder it, without conſtraining and perſecuting any man; for the enjoyment of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby he doth not give any publike offence.</p>
                  <p>15. That a Chriſtian being a Magiſtrate, although his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ad theſe priviledges to him in his Magiſtracy, yet his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy doth not exalt him above the Church of Chriſt, that he ſhould have a right to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand any thing therein after his own wil, as in humane affaires; for Chriſt only who is the head, hath authority to command in the Church, <hi>and thoſe that either teach for Doctrines the Commandements of men; or impoſe thoſe Commandements upon others, to teach them, or obſerve them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught and impoſed, worſhip God in vain.</hi> Matth. 15. 9.</p>
                  <p>16. That the greateſt honour and priviledge that can befall to a Magiſtrate, as being a Chriſtian, is, to become a Member of the myſtical Body of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo to be under the ſpiritual inſpection, and care of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, and the diſpenſation of the myſteries and graces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>17. That a Chriſtian Magiſtrate being a fellow-Member of the Body of Chriſt, is obliged not only as a Magiſtrate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſee them in outward things for their good; but as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and Brother to watch over their ſoules, conſidering them in love, to provoke them, and ſtir them up to all good works.</p>
                  <p>18. That a Magiſtrate being a Chriſtian; although he is ſet over all men, in reſpect of the outward and viſible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſociety; yet in reſpect of the inward and ſpiritual Charge of ſoules committed to the Miniſters of Chriſt, he is under their care and inſpection, to be watched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:163962:18"/> that he ſhould walk worthy of God in the Heavenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>19. That although a Magiſtrate as a Chriſtian, is thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſpection of the Miniſterial function, as to his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal behaviour and walking in the holy profeſſion, and may lawfully be admoniſhed in caſe he doth any thing contrary to the rules of his profeſſion; yet his Magiſtratical function is not under the inſpection of the Miniſters of the Goſpel: for their line doth go no farther than their Stewardſhip; and their Stewardſhip doth go no further than the Myſteries and the houſe of God: therefore as the Miniſters are not ſet to overſee and direct him in his Magiſtracy; So he is not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them of his proceedings in State-matters.</p>
                  <p>20. That although the Miniſters of the Goſpel depend not upon the Authority of any men in the duties of their ſpiritual function; yet they are accountable, not only to the civil and Chriſtian Magiſtrate of the reaſon and manner of all their proceedings in their adminiſtrations; but to any other, that ſhall deſire to know what their way and purpoſe of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in any thing belonging to their profeſſion: <hi>becauſe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2. &amp; 1 Iohn 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>they are bound to reject all the hidden things of darknes, to walk in the light, and approve their wayes unto the Conſciences of all men, as in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. That a Concurrence of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate with the Miniſtery by way of Councel and cooperation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance &amp; protection in all things belonging to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom of Chriſt, is not only lawful, but very expedient and commendable, and a concurrence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery with the Magiſtracy, to teach both them and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the duties which God hath Commanded all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another is neceſſary; becauſe it is a part of that Charge which God hath given to the Miniſtery. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>22. That the Councels, the Reſolutions, the Lawes, and the executions of State-Government, which are the proper works of the Magiſtrate; whereupon according to his beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he doth attend, ought not publickly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:163962:19"/> by any of his Subjects; or in a privat way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</p>
                  <p>23. That the conjunction of endeavours in the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Miniſtery ought to be only for the publick good, either of Church or Common-wealth, or of both; and by each of them his work is to be done diſtinctly in the way of his own Calling, wherein Chriſt hath ſet him and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>24. That the Miniſterial Function and Stewardſhip of the Myſteries of God, which Chriſt hath appointed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for ſpiritual and eternal concernments, <hi>in foro interiori,</hi> may not be employed for bodily and temporal and State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments, as ſubordinate thereunto <hi>in foro exteriori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. That Miniſters as private men, and living as Members in a State, may and ought to contribute their natural Talents, to further the publick good thereof in ſubordination to the Magiſtrates lawful deſires, and to give example to others of their duty.</p>
                  <p>26. That Magiſtrates profeſſing Chriſtianity, if they make a faire ſhew and pretence to advance a publick good, but in effect be found manifeſtly to ſeeke nothing but their own private ends in their places, they may and ought diſcreetly to be admoniſhed of their duty, and warned of the danger of Hypocriſie; whereunto their paſſions, their pride, and their covetouſnes may lead them.</p>
                  <p>27. That Miniſters as they ought not to refuſe lawful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; wherein as Members of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> they may be called to do the publick ſome ſervice: ſo they may not entertain that employment after ſuch a manner as to be taken off thereby from their ſpiritual Function; or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and mix the uſe and end thereof with matters of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature to ſerve and pleaſe themſelves or other men thereby: <hi>for if I ſought to pleaſe men</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt. Gal.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>28. That all Conjunctions and Concurrences of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical and Miniſterial Functions which are not undertaken for their own direct ends and uſes reſpectively; but either by the neglect of thoſe ends, or by indirect meanes or commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Relations, tend to other ends, are unwarrantable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:163962:19"/> they take away the boundaries and right uſes of Chriſts Ordinances, and ſo apply them not to his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>29. That if Miniſters deal with a people, of matters which are the proper concernment of their particular Magiſtrate, with that people which is his Subject, they do manifeſtly ſet themſelves with him in his Charge, and whether they meddle with his matters towards his Subjects willingly and in love to him; or without love to him, and that either unwillingly as by command and conſtraint, or of their own accord, as by jealouſie and competition of intereſts: which way ſoever this is done, in all, or any of theſe caſes, it is evident they apply themſelves to their hearers, not as ſpiritual men and Diſciples of Chriſt, to ſpiritual men and to Chriſts Diſciples, but as intereſſed men to men of intereſt in this world; whether therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate be pleaſed or diſpleaſed, as a ſervice or diſſervice is done unto his Authority &amp; deſignes thereby, the ſervice of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> in all this is not regarded.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The matters of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment how to be thought upon. What they are in this controverſie.</head>
                  <p>Theſe Poſitions I hope will find no contradiction by any that I ſhall have to deal withall; but if any of them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, it may either be laid aſide or regularly diſcuſſed by it ſelf, if it deſerve to be handled by it ſelf; or if it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fundamental relation to the point of doubt, it may be brought in as one of the particulars afterward to be decided, when the Queſtion is fully ſtated, which now is to be done.</p>
                  <p>If then after all theſe material points of agreement there be any, that to maintain the practice of ſome, held at large, that Miniſters may meddle with State-matters, in their Pulpits, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, as of State-matters, to declare their judgment thereof unto their hearers; I ſhal declare that herein I do diſſent from them, and think it altogether unlawfull, in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and no wayes appertaining to the calling wherein Chriſt Jeſus hath ſet them over his people, to acquaint them with their own or other mens judgments, concerning the affaires and intereſts of their Magiſtrates, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commend or diſcommend the ſame unto them.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that although Miniſters living in a State as private men (for in a State they are nothing elſe; though in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:163962:20"/> of Chriſtianity they are publick perſons <hi>as a City ſet</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>on a hill</hi>) may take notice of State proceedings and intereſts, and heare and obſerve what others think thereof, and judge with themſelves (as Members concerned) what is to be thought thereof: yet I ſay, that it is unlawful for them to publiſh thoſe thoughts with Reference to their Miniſterial employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make it any way inſtrumental, to deface the ſame into the thoughts of the people, as to give them notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by way of publick intelligence. Nay it is a very great Queſtion with me; whether any other men being private and Subjects, may lawfully publiſh their own or other peoples thoughts, concerning their own State Affaires any other way; except only in times of general deliberations, wherein all are priviledged to propoſe by their Truſtees what their deſires and grievances are to have them redreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is far more unlawful for them upon ſuch obſervation of State matters to uſe any perſwaſions or inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to ſway this or that way the vulgar affections to or from thoſe that are in Authority; for the ſuggeſtions by which Miniſters ought to engage Subjects affections towards their Magiſtrates are not to be raiſed from any private obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations (which are deceitfull, and no true grounds to oblige the Conſcience unto any duty) but from the manifeſt will of God commanding the duty; and the nature of the Relation which God hath ſetled between Magiſtrates and Subjects which is grounded upon love, and doth partake of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction which is between Parents and Children; whence it is, that as our Parents are to be beloved of us their Children; not ſo much becauſe they do this or that particular favour unto us; but becauſe they are our Parents, and next unto God over us, becauſe God hath made them to be Authours and Protectors of our life and being, &amp; conduit-pipes of all bleſſings towards us; ſo Magiſtrates are proportionally to be reſpected by all dutiful Subjects upon the ſame grounds, &amp; not upon any particular contemplations which their obſervation of State-contrivements may lead them unto, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould become both leaders &amp; monitors towards their flocks: And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:163962:20"/> therefore as they ought to do nothing that may any way corrupt the ſimplicity of their mind from this ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due unto their Rulers: So they ſhould uſe none other motives or arguments to perſwade them thereunto, but ſuch as are powerful in this kind.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion then is not with me, whether faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may dogmatically from the word of God, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humane ſociety ſpeak in the Pulpit of the righteous wayes of governing States <hi>in Theſi &amp; Antitheſi?</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yea or no they may inſtruct, warne and exhort States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, concerning the duties of their Calling towards God and men, that they may know how to keep a good Conſcience therein according to the will of God revealed in his word? I ſay the Queſtion is not with me concerning theſe things: for I am cleer that the Miniſters of the Word may handle and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all humane and divine matters thus. But the Queſtion is concerning particular matters of State done or to be done <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> relating to our ſelves or our Neighbours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome of our intereſts lye: I ſay concerning ſuch matters, either to make narratives for information, or to apply thoſe matters to move the peoples affection to any humane Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, is a thing utterly unlawful in the Miniſterial Function as I conceive.</p>

                  <p>If now this aſſertion of mine ſhould be debated between me and ſuch as allow at large in Miniſters the handling of State-matters as ſome uſe to do; it ought to be offered as a doubt, and made a Queſtion indifferently thus.</p>
                  <q>Whether yea or no it be lawfull for the Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt in their Sermons or Teſtimonies concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to declare their opinions alſo concerning State-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, wherein the Magiſtrate is concerned; to make Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives to inform their hearers of the condition of State-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and of their Rulers wayes and deſignes, and to ſway directly or indirectly their Subjects affections this or that way in complyance to this or that worldly deſigne?</q>

                  <p>To this I ſay no, and if any man doth think otherwiſe, who doth not except any thing material againſt that which hath been ſaid hitherto; I ſhall willingly diſcourſe the matter with him, and ſift it to the brain. That it therefore may be known, by what rule I will ſubmit the matter to a tryal; I ſhall after theſe two Principles, which no rational man will deny or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt, as I ſuppoſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>That it is not to be counted lawfull for any Servant to do his Maſters ſervice, that which his Maſter doth not only not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but forbiddeth to be done therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>That it is not to be counted lawful for any Servant to do in his Maſters Service, that which is wholly contrary to the nature of the employment and doth fruſtrate the true end and effect of the work which is to be performed thereby; although his Maſter doth make no inhibition concerning it.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Principles to the Doubt.</head>
                  <p>I propoſe then the application of theſe Principles to be made in this order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let us conſider whether yea or no, the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to be accounted Servants to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> if yea, then whether he is not their Maſter? and his will in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice their law? if no, then whoſe Servants they are, and who elſe is their Maſter?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether yea or no to preach the Goſpel, or to bear witnes concerning <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> be the ſervice wherein they are employed?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What properly this ſervice is? and whether yea or no <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth allow them in going about it, to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to any thing elſe than to himſelf and his truth; according to the Commiſſion which is given them. <hi>Luke 24. 46, 47, 48. Act. 1. 8. and</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:163962:21"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, whether yea or no the Miniſters of the Goſpell are not expreſſely forbidden, to apply themſelves to any other teſtimony or doctrine, then that which is according to the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by theſe places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7. and 6. 3, 4, 5, 20, 21. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 17. and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, whether yea or no the Narratives, Inſinuations, and Applications, which are made of State matters in the ſermons of ſome, are not another kinde of teſtimony, then the words of the Lord Jeſus? and whether thoſe that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, in delivering the ſame, ſpeak the oracles of God? which in the Church of God alone ought to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, ſuppoſing there were no ſuch commandments and prohibitions limiting the ſervice of Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; yet it will be granted, that Miniſters ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of their own office and employment, and ought not to do that which is contrary thereunto: and if ſo, then we ought to reflect upon the poſitions, which have ſhewed the coexiſtence; the diſtinction and the concurrence of the Miniſteriall and Magiſtraticall offices under Chriſt, together with the properties of the Charge, of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, of the objects, and of the fundamentall Rights of the Function, to ſee whether yea or no ſuch a medling with State matters is not wholly contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, the proper end and effect of the work at which Chriſt doth aime, by the Miniſtery of the Goſpell; and the direct meanes, by which he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end to be gained, are to be conſidered; and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the proper end and effect of this practiſe, to ſee whether this practiſe doth not make voide the efficacie of thoſe direct means, and overthrow that end? and if ſo; then by the dictate of our Principles, we may conclude this Practiſe to be utterly unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have done with the Rules of Regulating this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and the method of bringing the doubt to a deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I think it not needfull nor fit at this time, to deſcend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:163962:22"/> any further to the particulars of the application; but if any thing be offered in a ſober way inducing thereunto, I ſhall not be a verſe from that which ſhall tend to edification.</p>

               <p>Now I ſhall come to another kinde of application, both of the whole, and eſpecially of the latter part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto our preſent ſtate, to ſee, what from theſe grounds, and this way, both of ſearching after truths, and of diſcovering duties, may be gathered, to redreſſe our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and prevent the increaſe of our calamities. For I told you, partly in the beginning of the whole Diſcourſe, partly at the entrie upon this laſt part thereof, (wherein I apply the Rules of debatement, unto the ſubject in hand) the aime which I have in handling theſe matters thus, which is diſtinctly this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch as pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate matters learnedly.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, in the whole I intend to meet with the ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſtrife, which hath taken poſſeſſion of the minds of very many of my brethren in the profeſſion; whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I love, and reſpect for that Truth which is in them; I reverence and embrace for their many good parts, and godly inclinations; and for their humane failings and infirmities, I heartily compaſſionate them in the bowels of Chriſt. For many of them, pretending to Learning, to a bookiſh knowledge of other mens opinions, and to a cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring faculty of all, that is not agreeable to the notions which they have taken up in point of Theorie; and to the intereſt of that party which they have embraced in point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, are pitifully ſnared in holes, and ſhut up in priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and can look upon nothing in a ſtreight line, but one way, they ſee all things through a multiplying glaſſe, another through a diminiſhing proſpective. Towards theſe men my ſcope is upon this occaſion: firſt, to prevent a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe controverſie: ſecondly, to let them ſee a Model and true Method, without by a ſing (if they can take it up ſo) how to order their thoughts ſpiritually, and rationally, to find out truths in a profitable Controverſie: for indeed this is that which is moſt ſeriouſly to be recommended to the Miniſters of the Goſpel above all other men: for ſeeing they are the men, above others, by whom the thoughts of all men are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:163962:22"/> ordered in doubtfull caſes, therefore they ought to finde themſelves obliged in conſcience above other men, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rightly and exactly ordered in all their thoughts and proceedings; but alſo to be able, in all things, to give a ſatisfactory reaſon to their own conſcience, and to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable and reaſonable men, an exact and full account, of the Rules by which they order thoſe thoughts, and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall proceedings, by which they have ſo great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the ſpirits of other men. He that muſt anſwer one day unto the Father of ſpirits, for all the impreſſions which he works upon the ſpirits of his children, ought to be very carefull, and watchfull over his own ſpirit to diſcern the motions thereof, that they may not be irregular: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight therefore in the ordering of our thoughts, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, chiefly in matters of debate, (for God is the finall Judge of all Controverſies) is one of the chiefeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments that can be recommended unto Miniſters, in theſe times of diſorder and confuſion, that they may be found faithfull in their places, without blame, and in peace before him who trieth the hearts: and this is indeed the principall aime which I have in the Body of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to put my Brethren upon the ſearch of the Rules, by which they ſhould walk in their hearts with him, and to draw them forth to give us an account thereof, before they take upon them to be many Maſters, leſt they receive the greater condemnation. I have a third aime alſo in the whole of that which hath been hitherto offered, which is this; to ſhew by the bye, and collaterally, the nature of our diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conſtitution, and courſes, with the evils which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and foment in one another thereby, both againſt the truth of Chriſtianitie, and againſt the wayes of Peace and Righteouſneſſe in the Common-wealth: and herein my full deſigne is by a cleer example of a regular and orderly way of meditation, to let ſome of thoſe that have an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own ſufficiencie and Doctoralitie, ſee, how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant moſt men are of the high-way and plain path to reall wiſdome; and of the direct and eaſie method to reſolve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall doubts; and conſequently how little cauſe many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:163962:23"/> have (who think themſelves no ſmall Clerks) to preſume upon their bookiſh knowledge, which yet I do not deſpiſe as unprofitable in its own meaſure; but this I muſt ſay of it, that it will be found in end to be comparatively, but a blockiſh, ſcantie, ſtinted, and partiall way of learning, which doth not contain the ten thouſand million part of that knowledge which is attainable by another way, which is plain, eaſie to be followed, and demonſtrable to thoſe, that look upon the holy Scriptures as Chriſtians ought to do, to ſee Chriſt therein, and Gods wayes towards man in him; and that look upon the works of God in the world, as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall men ought to do, to ſee the ordering of the creatures, of their faculties, and of their works towards their true ends, whereby they relate unto God in Chriſt; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering of them as they are taken off from their true ends, by miſſing of this Relation. If this way of attaining to true learning, and the method of ſearching into theſe veins of knowledge, and of drawing waters out of theſe Wels, were diſcovered; the other way, which is now ſo much followed, and doth occaſion moſt of our diſputes and conteſtations, would be found rather a matter of ſhew then of ſubſtance: I do not deny, but that the way of Collections and Reading hath its own uſefulneſſe, if it be accompanied with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of ſound meditation, and directed to its true end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but to make ſo much ado about it, as ſome do, to take upon them great matters by it, and to ſtir up much duſt and ſtrife in it, is one of the diſtracting vanities of our Age, which leads us from the way of Truth and Peace. <hi>Onely of pride co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth contention:</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) but with the well adviſed is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 10.</note> And in another place, <hi>With the lowly is wiſdome, whereas from pride cometh ſhame.</hi> As pride and folly, ſo contention and<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 2.</note> ſhame are inſeparable companions. And as the way to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is to be well adviſed; ſo nothing maketh a man ſo capable of good adviſe, as the lowlineſſe of his ſpirit. It would be an eaſie matter, to ſhew the truth of theſe Proverbs verified, in the management of our ordinarie courſe of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wherein there is no lowlineſſe of ſpirit, nor good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be found, towards the attainment of wiſdome, but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:163962:23"/> meer pride in things of no value, which lead us through contentiouſneſſe unto ſhame. I ſhall not now take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the Principles, the ſtrains, and the pinacles of the height, whereupon the literature, the Philoſophie, and the Divinity of the Schools is ſet, and doth exalt the Doctors and Diſciples thereof, to a conceit of their own ſufficiencie above thoſe that are counted illiterate, it were an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhew comparatively to the plain and lowly way of ſeeking knowledge, the fooliſh emptineſſe of thoſe toilſome ſtrains, and the ſhamefull vanity which is in the affectation of, and a pretenſion to a titular eſteeme of learning before men, by a Science falſly ſo called: at this time it will be enough to ſay that which Chriſt ſaid to the Phariſees, when they derided his ſimplicitie; <hi>That which is highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>men, is abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> For theſe ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited wayes of learning, are ſo far from making men either wiſer or better then others, that for the moſt part (except God over-act and over-power them with ſpeciall grace) it makes them ſo much the more unſerviceable to others, by how much they ſtrive to be ſet above them, and at a diſtance from their capacities; and ſo much the more incapable of the truth of wiſdome and vertue for themſelves, by how much it ſets them neerer to their own wit, and further off from the ſimplicitie and humilitie which is in Chriſt Jeſus. This matter is a larger ſubject then now I am willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon; nor is it yet ſeaſonable to undertake it: perhaps God will ſhew a way to meddle with theſe matters, and offer occaſions, which ſhall be more free from offence then theſe times ſeem to afford: for I am not willing, either to joyne hands with the perſecuters of learned men, becauſe they are learned, or to be thought a favourer of thoſe, who now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes are mad againſt all that looks towards or like Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (a generation of men, that knowing nothing, and yet preſuming without Learning to know all; think it their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that any ſhould be thought more knowing then themſelves; and being led without any grounds or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by their own meer whimſeys, can endure nothing that is like a ſettlement, and looks towards the Regulating and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:163962:24"/> compoſure of mens ſpirits.) For I confeſſe, that upon the name of Learning too much dirt and contempt is caſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, though wrongfully as from ſuch men, yet deſervedly as from God: for by reaſon of the ambitiouſneſſe of thoſe that unprofitably have walked in a vain ſhew of Learning, and under a pretence thereof have ſought nothing, but eaſe, plentie, and pre-eminencie, and by reaſon of the ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe of thoſe that partially walk ſtill in ſtrife about it, and have made their Learning a ſeed of gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, to embitter and embroil the ſpirits of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for certain private opinions. (I ſay) by reaſon of theſe abuſes of the wayes of Learning, which ſtill continue amongſt thoſe that ſtrive to be thought Maſters of it, God doth juſtly poure contempt upon them, and will not ceaſe to ſtain the pride of all their glory, and their greatneſſe, by a full diſcovery of their ſhame, till they ſhew themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with all their deviſes, and ſhews of greatneſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and till all the monopolizing practiſes, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous incroachments, whereby the enlargement of common helps to true Learning towards all, are enviouſly obſtructed, be taken out of the way, and forſaken. And in hope that this may be done, we ſhall endevour without partialitie, <hi>to ſowe the ſeed</hi> which God hath put in our hand, <hi>upon all waters</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa 32. 20.</note> (upon all ſorts of people, and upon all objects of knowledge)<note place="margin">Gal 6. 9.</note> for we may expect, that <hi>in due time we ſhall reap the fruit thereof, if we faint not:</hi> and this is the firſt part of my aime in the whole, even to provoke ſuch as are capable of theſe thoughts, to peaceable and orderly meditations, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts concerning themſelves in all matters of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

                  <head>The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to all that in the Magiſtracy and Miniſtery pretend to walk by the rules of Love, of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and of Peace.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, in the laſt part of that which I have formerly inſiſted upon, where I ſpeak of the difference and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Magiſtraticall and Miniſteriall functions; my purpoſe is by a ſearch into the nature and Properties of both offices, as in ſubordination unto Chriſt they relate each other; to diſcover the Rules of Chriſtian Love, of Righteouſneſſe, and of Peaceableneſſe obſervable between them, for the good of humane ſocieties: to the end that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:163962:24"/> ſuch as make conſcience their Rule, may ſee the path of Chriſtianity, wherein they ought to walk; and that ſuch as pretend to walk by the rule of Reaſon, and yet make their own will indeed rather then any thing elſe a rule to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; may either be rectified by that which they pretend to walk by, or brought to the light and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be ſelf-willed and unreaſonable; and that ſuch as againſt both Conſcience and Reaſon are evill affected to the welfare of the publick; may be prevented in the miſchief which their practiſes may work againſt the ſafetie and quietneſſe of the ſtate, and of thoſe that are peaceable in the land. For in theſe doubtfull, diſtracted and troubleſome times; the greater our confuſions are, the more it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſettle our judgement by a rule; that in matters of cleer duty, where Gods will is known, a good conſcience may ſee where it ought to reſt, and in matters of Debate, wherein circumſtances are to be weighed, the common grounds of reaſon by the true method of reaſoning may take place: for there is none other way imaginable to deal effectually and to meet with the ſpirit of ſelf will, of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of preſumption (the great traitours of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocieties) then to act thus, by undeniable Principles and Rules; and to oblige thoſe with whom we act, and our ſelves alſo; to go no further then theſe direct us; for I ſuppoſe all will grant this freely, that thus farre all men, in all places are bound to deny themſelves; nor ſhall it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that any man, in any place ſhould deny himſelf further, then to exalt above his own apprehenſions and purpoſes the common grounds of Truths and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and this we hope they whom we deal withall will readily yeeld unto.</p>
                  <p>That therefore the turbulent inclinations, which with ſome are in the dark; with others are apparent, may be convicted and caſt out of all; I ſhall endeavour to ſhew briefly the rules, by which the Chriſtian Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in their ſeverall places reſpectively, for the good of the people committed to their charges, ought to walk in Love, in Righteouſneſſe, and in Peace towards each other;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:163962:25"/> that that which is obſervable at all times as a direction to our happineſſe, may by Gods bleſſing at this time be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto our preſent condition, as a reſtauration from our miſeries, and a preſervation from the ruine wherewith otherwiſe unavoidably we are threatned.</p>
                  <p>To come then to that, which is the fruit of all theſe conſiderations, and that which ought to be the finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all the Debates which may be undertaken about theſe matters.

                  <p>Concerning the proper works of the Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, as they relate unto the ends for which Chriſt doth employ them in his ſervice; they muſt be diſcovered by looking upon the aime which God hath in making them that which they are, and which they ought to have in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their places upon them.</p>
                  <p>The end which God hath in making ſuch officers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:163962:25"/> amongſt men is mainly this, to manifeſt the glory of his own goodneſſe and his ſupremacy in all things over man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For <hi>the Lord hath made all things for himſelf</hi> firſt; and<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 4 Pſal. 8.</note> then alſo for man, that in the right uſe of all things under God, man might ſhew forth his glory; and thereby attain to true happineſſe: for happineſſe in man is nothing elſe but to partake (ſo farre as he is capable) of the goodneſſe of God, which is his glory towards us. Now the goodneſſe of God in the hand of his Supremacy diſpenſing all things, runnes in two Channels, which anſwer to the twofold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the life of man; to the two ſorts of Creatures which God hath made in the world, and to the twofold way of putting forth his infinite vertues: the two faculties of the life of man, are Bodily and Spirituall; the two ſorts of creatures which God hath filled the world with, are ſome viſible, and ſome inviſible; and the twofold way of putting forth his vertue is, by Nature and by Grace. In theſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels the glory of God is conveighed by the creatures unto the faculties of man; that all may partake thereof and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happie therein, and that one creature in the way of God may conveigh the ſame to another. Now that man, <hi>who is borne like a wilde aſſes colt,</hi> may be directed by the right<note place="margin">Job 11. 12.</note> uſe, both of his faculties, and of the creatures, to attaine to his happineſſe; God hath appointed ſome inſtruments, to lead him towards the way thereof, which are called Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters: and leſt theſe, who by nature are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſer nor better then all the reſt, ſhould be ignorant of the true way wherein they ought to direct others, he hath given to them both, one Supream head and director, his onely begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the worlds viſible and inviſible were made; by whom the Father hath brought back all things unto himſelf again, which were at a diſtance from him, by reaſon of the curſe: by whom all things bodily and ſpirituall in man are reſtored to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, and inabled to act towards God: by whom all the creatures ſubſiſt, and are made again the receptacles of Gods goodneſſe in nature and grace, and by whom, and in whom alone all the manifeſtation of Gods goodneſſe is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:163962:26"/> apparent, and the way to happineſſe by giving God his glory, is made plain in the nature of man: and therefore he is ſet as the head of all things over mankind, and given as the Soveraign Director of thoſe who are to direct others in the way to felicity, as well Bodily as Spirituall, as well by Nature as by Grace. Thus then Gods aime is to glorifie himſelf in his Son; and to glorifie his Son over all, and to glorifie mankind by making it happy in conformitie to his Son: and that the life and vertue of his Son, which is the fountain of Glory, and the ſpring of living waters, may as a river flow out and be diſperſed to all that ſtand in need of comfort: he hath ſet inſtruments under him, as conduit pipes in the two channels of his vertue, to conveigh the ſame unto others. Theſe Inſtruments are the forenamed Magiſtrates and Miniſters, who are ſet to receive from Chriſt all that which is diſpenſable unto humane ſocieties for their happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Between theſe two the Magiſtrate is firſt, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that was not firſt which is ſpirituall, but that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and afterward that which is ſpirituall.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 46. the Miniſter therefore is the ſecond in order: for all his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations preſuppoſe a man to be under the government, and in the right channell of nature; or at leaſt capable of the adminiſtrations belonging thereunto: ſo then God hath made the Magiſtrate to ſtand by himſelf under Chriſt in the diſpenſation of the means of naturall felicitie, that he may<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> learn of him as his diſciple, how to manifeſt the glory of Gods goodneſſe unto all fleſh.</p>

                  <p>The aime therefore which the Magiſtrate, as he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ought to have in taking his place upon him, is to ſet himſelf under Chriſt, as his ſervant and inſtrument, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh to the ſocieties of men by naturall means the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Gods gooneſſe, that he may be glorified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and they may be happie thereby in this world: and to this effect his more immediate aime and deſigne ſhould be, to employ the power and authority of his place, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward ſocieties of men in unity, to overſee, and rectifie all their actions, which are contrary to the will of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:163962:26"/> God in nature, and by his conduct to ſettle men together in a condition of life, wherein Godlineſſe and Honeſty<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> may be maintained and advanced, and ſafetie with Peace and Plentie enjoyed without diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>From this deſcription of his aime, as it ariſeth naturally from Gods end in giving him his employment, we may gather two things, both what his proper works are, and what the propertie of his way is in going about them.</p>
                  <p>His proper works are, to ſet a foot all the meanes which he can uſe in his place, by which theſe ends may be brought to paſſe: and the propertie of his way in going about thoſe works is, to carry himſelf ſutably to the nature of men, with whom he hath to deal, to the eminencie of the place wherein he is ſet, and to the qualitie of the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he doth make uſe; here then, if we will reflect upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, we ſhall finde theſe to be his proper works.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, to provide for the life of Godlineſſe by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and advancement of the Chriſtian Religion, and of the profeſſors thereof, to ſhew himſelf a Nurſing Father of them, and of the wayes of Gods worſhip in the

                  <p>In reference to the qualitie of the meanes, which are made uſe of, his way is to act by Commiſſion and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Authority, of right and of power unto ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate officers, who may act in the name of the Supreame; and may not be lawfully reſiſted, in that which they have

And to this effect; Chriſt doth appoint them as his meſſengers to be witneſſes of his Truth, which is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made between God and man in himſelf, and to be<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> ſervants to the ſocieties of beleevers, the publick profeſſors of his truth, for his ſake: they are alſo made ſubjects for the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> Lords ſake unto every ordinance of man, as all other men are, that they may give others a good example of orderly walking, and of harmleſneſſe in the life of nature.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>And of his way in going about it.</head>
                  <p>Now by this appointment of God concerning them, it is evident, that they in their places are not properly <hi>over men</hi> as Magiſtrates are in humane affairs, to command, and compell obedience to that which they inioyn; but onely <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men</hi> in Divine affairs, to let them know the will of God, and to intreat them to yeeld obedience thereunto for Chriſts ſake; and in caſe men will not hearken to them, they have no more to do, but to ſhake off the duſt from their feet, and declare the judgement of God unto them.</p>
                  <p>And as they have no maſterly or commanding power over either the outward concernments, or the faith of thoſe to whom they are ſent, ſo they have no right to ſhare any way with the Magiſtrate in his employments, no more then his meaneſt Subject, nor to meddle with the adminiſtration of any of his works, nor to incroach upon any part of his Authority, nor to make any mixture of his employments with their own under any publick pretence whatſoever; but in all outward and viſible concernments, to be as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh meer Subjects, and under the Supreme Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exemption, or any priviledge (by the title of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons) to be free from his juriſdiction, as the Man of Sin pretends his ſervants ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the aime which the Miniſter of the Goſpel
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:163962:28"/> ought to have in taking his place upon him, is to ſet himſelf under Chriſt in his employment, as his ſervant and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards the ſpirits of men; that by grace he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the teſtimony of Gods ſpirituall goodneſſe to them, that they by entertaining the ſame may glorifie God, and become happy both in this world, and in the world to come. And to this effect, his more immediate aime ſhould be, to teach thoſe that know not Chriſt to know him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to beleeve in him, and to profeſſe his Name: and thoſe that profeſſe him, to walk by the Spirit of Chriſt with God in the Covenant, entertaining and obſerving the tenor thereof through conformitie to the croſſe of Chriſt, in hope<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> of being glorified together with him.</p>

                  <p>And from this deſcription of his aime, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt concerning him towards his employment, we may ſee that his proper works, and the property of his way in going about the ſame, are, as farre different from that of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates works and way, as the life of Nature is from the life of grace, as viſible things are from inviſible, as meer reaſon is from revelation, as ruling is from doing ſervice, as coaction is from ſupplication, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding is from being in ſubjection, as the outward man is from the inward, as this world is from that which is to come, as to be dead, and crucified unto this preſent life, is from ſeeking after the enjoyment of happineſſe therein, and as bearing witneſſe concerning the will and Word of God, to incline the conſcience to yeeld it ſelf willingly thereunto, is from an injunction brought forth by the will and word of man, with a purpoſe to ſee it actually performed, and perſonall obedience yeelded thereunto, whether it be done willingly or no. So that except men wil purpoſely ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to go beyond their line, and neglect their own work, to take another mans work out of his hand; there can be no interfaring of the employments; and yet they may be as intimately coordinate, concurrent, and ſubſervient to their joynt end of humane happineſſe, and the glory of God in Chriſt, as ſenſe is coordinate, concurrent, and ſubſervient unto Reaſon; or right reaſon unto Conſcience, or a good

                  <p>Thus we have briefly ſeen the proper works of theſe employments, as they relate unto the ends for which Chriſt hath appointed them. We ſhall not need to deſcend unto the particulars of the Miniſteriall works, it ſufficeth for our purpoſe in hand, to have diſcovered this, that by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, for the glory of his Grace in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as crucified unto the world on the one hand; and for the glory of his Supreame power in Chriſt, as exalted over the world on the other hand: the ſeverall, proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ends and aimes of the Magiſtraticall and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall employments, are put in two peculiar channells; and accordingly that their works are ſo diſtinct, as the work of the minde is from that of the bodie, and their wayes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them ſo different, as the way to frame and beget inward thoughts towards God, is from the way to order mens outward actions in a ſocietie towards men. For to attend the latter belongeth wholly to the Magiſtrate, as to attend the former is wholly peculiar to the Miniſter. And although the Magiſtrate, as a Chriſtian, may intend as occaſion is offered, to help, by the Spirituall Talent which God hath beſtowed upon him, his Brethren in the way of ſetting their hearts aright towards God (nor is this any prejudice, but rather an advantage to the Miniſter of the Goſpell) yet he cannot be obliged to give attendance unto that employment, as to a function of his Magiſtracy: nor is that to be reckoned as any part or act of his ruling office: but to the Miniſter it is his whole office to attend this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, by labouring in the word and prayer for it. Nor is it lawfull for him as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, either to attend or to intend any thing elſe but this: it is true, that as a neighbour in humane ſocieties, he may occaſionally adviſe (being called thereunto) that which is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be done in the outward actions of men: (nor is any prejudice, but rather an advantage to the Magiſtrate in the State,) but if his aime ſhould be to intend or attend, the regulating of mens naturall wayes; or the judging of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:163962:29"/> men by their actions authoritatively or powerfully as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of their outward behaviour; he hath forſaken his owne employment, he hath uſurped the ſtation and place of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, he hath brought the ſtate of Nature, which is ſingle, under the intanglement of a twofold government, he doth confound the conduit-pipes of the Spirituall and Naturall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, wherein Gods goodneſſe ſhall appeare and run, though joyntly, yet diſtinctly; and he doth lay in the ſpirits of men, and in the frame of their aſſociation, the foundations of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and builds up the Myſtery of Iniquity thereupon, whereby worldly intereſts are covered with religious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the conſciences of beleevers enſlaved to the wills of men, and the Truth and Ordinances of God perverted to ſerve hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policies and deceitfull practices. For indeed this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aim of the Miniſteriall function, is the very Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of that myſtery, which the man of ſin hath maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſion of the truth, ever ſince Chriſtian Societies have appeared in the ſtate of the world to be conſiderable.</p>

And the<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 11, 12, 13, &amp;c. and chap. 19, 20.</note> greater the naturall and acquired parts and gifts of this man are, and the more revealed and ſpirituall truths, or myſtcall ſhewes thereof he doth mix with this kind of ſervice, the more fire he doth cauſe to come down from heaven, and the more deeply he doth deceive; and therefore he ſhall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly receive alſo with the falſe Prophet ſo much the more of his reward, if he repent not.</p>

For except God turn their hearts to a right courſe, and ſet them upon the works of their calling wthout partiality, and direct their counſels in a loving, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and peaceable way, (as Chriſt hath appointed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to walk for his glory) towards the good of thoſe that are under their charge, and for their own mutuall happineſſe, they ſhall never be able for feare of one another, to intend, or attend any other deſignes but ſuch as are acted by power and violence; whereupon the great Dragon their maſter in theſe courſes doth ſet them; and whieh for want of Chriſtian love and compaſſion, can end in nothing elſe but in mercileſſe cruelties, equally ruinous to each other, and to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of humaneſocieties.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto we have ſeen both what the proper workes and wayes of the Magiſtracy and Miniſtery are, as they relate unto the ends for which Chriſt hath ordained them; and what the error and deviation is from thoſe works and wayes. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo what this deviation doth produce in all ſocieties, where the duties of Love, of Righteouſneſſe and of Peace, are not thought upon, to referre the whole ſtate thereof unto Chriſt, as Chriſtians ought to doe. Let us now come to the ſecond point of our Diſquirie, which is to diſcover what the naturall properties and proper acts are of true Love, of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and of Peaceableneſſe, which Chriſtians, and chiefly their Leaders unto happineſſe, ought to intend towards all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:163962:31"/> men, but eſpecially towards each other in the workes of their employment, and above all in times of diſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of theſe duties ingenerall, as to commend their worth, their neceſſity, their uſefulneſſe, and ſuch like, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it needleſſe: for certainly it is not ſo much for want of knowledge of that which we ought to doe, that we run into errors, as by reaſon of our perturbation, and of our by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, which beget in us a diſregarding of theſe, and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of other matters; and are begotten in us through partiality in our ſelves, and fore-ſtalment of thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others: For it is by reaſon of theſe things that we play the hypocrites, and lye againſt the Truth; for which cauſe our ſin is the greater: <hi>For to him that knoweth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 17.</p>

                  <head>Of the duty of Chriſtian love by it ſelfe.</head>
                  <p>Therefore as concerning the duty of Chriſtian Love, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed in probability, that any in the Miniſtery, or in any other charge amongſt Chriſtians, ſhould be ignorant of the nature therof; becauſe it is known to all that have been taught the firſt Principles of the knowledge of Chriſt, that the duty of Chriſtian love is two-fold: Firſt, the affection by which we cleave to God as to our Father in Chriſt: And next, the affection by which we embrace our neighbour for Gods ſake, as Chriſt hath embraced us. Now concerning our love to God, and friendſhip to Chriſt, it is evident that it ſtands onely in this, That we keep the commandements of the Father, and that we doe whatſoever Chriſt doth enjoyne us to performe, <hi>John</hi> 15. 14. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 5. whence it is further manifeſt, that to neglect the known will of God, and to ſet our ſelves in a courſe which is contrary to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is openly to renounce Chriſts friendſhip, and plainly to become a hater of God, and hatefull to him. And as for the commandement wherein God will have us to ſhew our love, and Chriſt our friendſhip to himſelf, it is known by all, to be none other but the Law of Love, whereof the whole ſubſtance hath been delivered unto us in the new commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt hath given us when he ſairh, <hi>John 13. 34, 35. A new Commandement I have given you, That ye love one another as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another: by this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:163962:32"/> ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if yee have love one to another.</hi> The true evidence then of our love towards God, is this, <hi>That we love the Brethren: For he that ſaith he loveth God, and hateth his brother, is a lyar,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John 4. 20, 21. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? And this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement have we from him, That he that loveth God, love his brother alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The end (for this alwayes is to be lookt upon as that which doth manifeſt the nature and property of every thing) of love, is to ſeek the good of that which is beloved; <hi>Now our goodneſſe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 10. 24. 1 Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>cannot extend unto God,</hi> therefore God hath appointed us to beſtow that good which by us is communicable, upon men, our brethren, that beare his image: <hi>For love ſeeketh not his own, but the good of others.</hi> And in Chriſtian love the good which is to be ſought, and the way of ſeeking and imparting it unto others, is no where ſo diſcernable as in the example of Chriſts love unto us: for he procured and imparted unto us that which in it ſelfe was the onely good; and to us that whereof we ſtood in greateſt need: For nothing it ſelf is good, but God, and that which advanceth his glory: Now we were ſeparate from God, and <hi>came ſhort of his glory,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. <hi>but Chriſt brought us neare unto him, and received us into his glory,</hi> Rom. 15. 7. Epheſ. 2. 13. Whence it is that the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us, <hi>to receive one another, as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of Goll,</hi> Rom. 5. 7. The end then and aim of Chriſtian love, doth tend to that good alone, which makes us partakers of Gods glory: for it aimes at the reall perception of Gods kindneſſe, of his mercy, of his truth, of his faithfulneſſe, and of all his goodneſſe towards us; that all may find it, and in the covenant of Grace through Ieſus Chriſt embrace it: for this is that glory whereinto Chriſt did receive us. As for the way of ſeeking and imparting this good unto others, we ſee by Chriſts example, a moſt excellent property of this love, that it doth humble and deny it ſelfe, and forſakes its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and conveniencies for the good of others, and that even to the utmoſt: For Chriſt through his love to us, though <hi>he was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:163962:32"/> God, yet made himſelfe of no reputation, but took the ſhape of a Servant upon him, and became obedient even unto death, and laid down his life for us.</hi> Whence it is alſo, that we are exhorted by the Apoſtles, <hi>to have the ſame mind wich was in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> Phil, 2. 7. And <hi>to lay down our lives for the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then that the naturall properties, and proper acts of Chriſtian love, tend wholly to engage the heart firſt to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience unto the will of God in all things, and then particularly to obey his will in this, That we ſhould procure the good of our neighbour, even as Jeſus Chriſt did procure for us that which was our good. Thus then through love to him, to doe to others that which he did to us, is the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtian love.</p>

And according to this Rule God ſhall right all things that are out of frame; <hi>for with what meaſure we mete unto others, it ſhall be meaſured unto us again, Matth.</hi> 7. 2. Now the cauſe why Love is the root of Righteouſneſſe, is, becauſe it engageth the affection to be harmleſſe, and to pay willingly unto others all things which are due unto them for their good. Whence it is alſo cleare, that hatred is the root of all unrighteouſneſſe, becauſe it engageth the affection to the quite contrary motions. Now as Righteouſneſſe is the daughter of Love; ſo it is the mother of Peaceableneſſe: for by giving to every one his due, contentedneſſe is begotten, which preventeth the cauſe of ſtrife, and maintaineth peace. So then the end of Righteouſneſſe is to direct our way to live with God by the uprightneſſe of our ſpirit and actions, in conformity to his will.</p>
                  <p>As concerning Peaceableneſſe, the nature and property of it, is inwardly, that <hi>quiet and meek diſpoſition of the mind, which is of great price in the ſight of God:</hi> and outwardly, that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4.</note> and gentlenes of the carriage towards men, which neither taketh nor giveth occaſion of offences.</p>

                  <head>Of the duty of Peaceablenes</head>
                  <p>The end of Peaceableneſſe is to maintain, increaſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the joy which commeth from the enjoyment, the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and recovery of that which is good, appertaining to us in the way of righteouſnes. And to gain this end, two things are in the life of Chriſtianity to be obſerved, namely, what the proper acts of Peaceablenes are in our ſelves, and towards others; and whence the diſpoſition of the ſoul which doth beget them, is begotten in us,</p>
                  <p>The proper acts of Peaceablenes in our ſelves are, <hi>to ſtudy to be quiet, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 4. 11. not to mind high things, but to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to things of low degree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. for of <hi>Pride cometh nothing but contention, Prov. 13. 10. and to behave and quiet our ſelves as a child that is weaned from his mother, Pſa</hi> 131. that is, to wean our ſoules from the luſts of the fleſh; for warres and fightings come from nothing elſe but from our luſts that warre in our members, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 1. if therefore we have <hi>Salt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:163962:33"/> within our ſelves</hi> to mortifie theſe luſts, we ſhall be able <hi>to have Peace one with another,</hi> as Chriſt commands us. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 50.</p>
                  <p>The acts of Peaceableneſſe towards others are, in reſpect of all men, to <hi>ſhew all meekneſſe unto all men: Tit.</hi> 3. 2. in reſpect of thoſe that are of a quiet diſpoſition, to be of the ſame minde towards them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit with them in the bond of Peace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. not envying them, nor provoking them, nor being deſirous of vain glory towards them: <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 26. In reſpect of thoſe that are of an unquiet diſpoſition, to follow Peace, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it towards them: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. and that even ſo far as it is poſſible, and as much as in us lyeth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. to do all things without murmurings and diſputings againſt them, in a blameleſſe and harmleſſe way, that they may have no cauſe to murmure at us, or to diſpute with us. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And to this effect, to lay aſide all malice, and all guil, and hypocriſie, &amp; evil ſpeakings, and ſurmiſings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. And laſtly, in reſpect of thoſe that are injurious, to recompenſe no evill for evill, nor to avenge our ſelves, but to give place unto wrath. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17, 19. Not to be overcome with evill, but to overcome evil with good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 21. And to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, with all lowlineſſe and meekneſſe, with long-ſuffering, to forbear them in love. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 2. And to forgive them as God in Chriſt hath forgiven us. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 32.</p>
                  <p>Now the originall and immediate cauſe of this Peaceable diſpoſition of the ſoul, is to ſuffer the Peace of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are called, to rule in our hearts; <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 15. for when this (by the new Covenant in Chriſt) doth poſſeſſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſoul is quieted within it ſelf; becauſe it entreth with Chriſt into that reſt which he hath purchaſed and prepared for it. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 10, 11. And it receiveth the Peace which he hath left with it, and given to it; ſo that the heart is not troubled, neither is it afraid at any thing which in this world can befall unto it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. for the promiſe of the Lord, wherein he hath cauſed us to hope, doth ſuſtain us, which ſaith, that he <hi>will keep him in perfect Peace whoſe heart is ſtayed on him, becauſe he truſteth in him.</hi> Iſa. 26. 3. But on the other ſide, thoſe that have no intereſt in the Covenant of Peace which Chriſt hath made with us, can have no reſt nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:163962:34"/> quietneſſe within themſelves, or towards others; becauſe my God hath ſaid, <hi>There is no Peace to the wicked:</hi> but his heart and his whole courſe is, as the troubled Sea, which cannot reſt, but caſteth forth mire and dirt perpetually. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>The ends then of theſe duties ſhew the perfection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they lead us, and their proper works the way, by which we attain the ſame. For by the law of love we are taught how to aime at that which is truly good; by the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, how to order our way in proſecuting of it; and by the law of Peaceableneſſe, how to attend the delightfull poſſeſſion of it. The firſt ſets our minde upon God; the ſecond directs us to him, and the third fits us to enjoy him.</p>

                  <head>What is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in theſe duties more then to other men.</head>
                  <p>Thus in brief we ſee what theſe duties are, and whence in a Chriſtian more then in other men they proceed; for other men know nothing herein but the principles of Reaſon and Morality, by which they look more upon the materiall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the works, then upon any thing elſe; becauſe naturall men cannot raiſe their minds unto the apprehenſion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall truths, which beget in the ſoul a new life, and farre leſſe can they act any thing thereby without ſpeciall grace: yet if the Intellectuals of a man truly rationall in nature (which is not altogether impoſſible) be raiſed ſo far, by the right uſe of common illuminations, as to perceive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which is between ſuch performances, as theſe are, and the principles from whence they flow, he will finde no juſt cauſe to contradict any thing therin, although his heart will not be able thereupon to cloſe with the duties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for a true Chriſtian is a ſpirituall man, is not inabled to cloſe heartily with theſe duties, either becauſe he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of the rationalitie thereof; or becauſe he doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the excellencie and worth of this way, above the way of Morality (for theſe are onely preparative inducements inclining his affection thereunto) but he cloſeth therewith onely becauſe his conſcience is enlightned by the truth, and purified by faith: and therein is bound over, and given up to walk thus with God in Chriſt by the covenant of grace: for through the law of the ſpirit of life and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus, whereby he is freed from the law of ſin, and of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:163962:34"/> death, he is made conformable unto the image of the Son of God; and the righteouſneſſe of the Law of God through faith and love being fulfilled in him, he hath peaceable commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father, and with the Son, wherein he doth ſet himſelf to walk with joy, and unſpeakable comfort in the light of their countenance, by which he is daily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from glory to glory, as by the Spirit and preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The rule then, and the way of a Chriſtian is to walk in theſe duties towards all men, and for theſe ends; not with humane wiſdome, and the reaſonings of his naturall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (although he doth nothing irrationally) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction and manifeſtation of the Spirit of grace: that is, according to the teſtimony of Jeſus, revealed unto his ſpirit, which obligeth his conſcience to follow affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately the rules of theſe duties, in all ſimplicitie and godly ſincerity; through love to the life of Jeſus Chriſt, and the grace of God in him; and not for any other obligation, or by any other conſideration whatſoever: and whoſoever doth walk after this rule, Peace be upon him, and upon the Iſrael of God. And becauſe we have not hitherto walked after this rule, we have not as yet found the way to Peace; for to finde Peace out of this way, is as impoſſible as to miſſe of it, within it.</p>

                  <head>How univerſal they are, and inſeparable from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And chiefly in leading men, and times of greateſt need.</head>
                  <p>From hence we may obſerve, that theſe duties have an univerſall influence upon all the wayes of Chriſtians; for as Chriſtians, they are eſſentiall to them in all the works of their ſeverall callings; and if they ſtudie not to do all their works by theſe rules, they cannot be ſaid to do them as Chriſtians; for as Chriſtians we are commanded to do all our matters with charitie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 14. for we are obliged by the love of God to us, <hi>as his dear children to be followers of God; and to walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2. And if we walk not thus, it is evident that we are none of his children, but have renounced his love, and are deſtitute of the life of God in all our undertakings; for <hi>he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love. 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 8. And again, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians we are bound to ſerve God, and Chriſt in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:163962:35"/> and if we ſerve him not, how can we truly bear his Name? Now the kingdom of God, wherein we are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live, and wherein all our works are to be done as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto him, is <hi>righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt: and he that in theſe things doth ſerve Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of men:</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18. If then we ſerve not Chriſt in theſe things, or intend them not at all; how can we be called his ſervants, or ſaid to live in his kingdom? The end of the whole profeſſion of Chriſtianity, as to us men, within our ſelves, and in reference to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 4.</note> is the fulfilling of our joy. This end is attained, when we partake of the righteouſneſſe and peace which is in Chriſt Jeſus; and when through his love, we are moved and inabled, to impart that which we do partake unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by the enlargement of grace, there may be a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy in all. For all that profeſſe the name, and partake of the life of Chriſt, have an intereſt in one another; and as by their right and priviledge to him, they may challenge from each other the conſolation that is in him, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2.</note> of his love, and the fellowſhip of his ſpirit; ſo it ought to be one of their chief aimes, in the common profeſſion, and indeed is the main of their duty therein, to intend, and to impart theſe things effectually towards one another: which if they do not, they neither ſerve Chriſt, nor ſeek their own good in his kingdom; but in very deed, renounce him, and his ſervice, and their intereſt in each other, and the whole truth of the profeſſion. And if in all mens actions, and at all times theſe Rules are ſo neceſſarie, and fundamentally eſſentiall to Chriſtianity, that nothing can be acceptable to God, nor profitable to men without the obſervance thereof; then we muſt needs conclude, that they are moſt of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in the chiefeſt actions, of our chiefeſt men that are leaders in the profeſſion; and at the times of our greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities and difficulties. For if in ſuch times we take not counſell at the mouth of the Law, and of the teſtimony; we can expect no dawning of the day of ſalvation, nor morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20. 22.</note> light ariſing to us: but in all our doubts we ſhall meet with eaſeleſſe grief and trouble, in all our deliberations with

                  <p>Now to the end, that at this time, and in the ſtraits whereunto God hath brought us, partly for our finnes, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fit us for his Kingdom, we may not miſcarrie, and fall into ſuch ſad inconveniences: and that by the neglect of our duty, let us come unto the third and laſt point of our diſquirie, which is to be the fruit and concluſion of all that hath been ſaid hitherto.

                  <head>How theſe Rules are to be made uſe of to cure our diſeaſes viz. By the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. </head>
                  <p>To ſee in our preſent condition how theſe Rules ſhould be obſerved, by thoſe that are in place to cure our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                  <p>And to this effect I ſhall, as briefly as may be, look upon our preſent condition, upon our diſtempers therein which are the cauſes of our diſeaſe; and upon the Method of the cure, by the application of the Remedie thereunto</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, that our preſent condition is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently underſtood, by the ſeverall parties whereinto we are fallen; ſome look this way, ſome that way upon it: but all that can diſcern any thing which is to be ſeen; or judge of the reaſons of what they ſee: may diſcern this of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we are neither ſetled in, nor much inclined to entertaine, peaceable affections: that we are ſtrangely by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed, and broken to pieces in our wayes and actings: that moſt of us are beſet outwardly with difficulties, (burdens on the one hand, wants on the other;) and many poſſeſt inwardly with ſcrupulous perplexities about the way to be eaſed thereof. And thoſe that can judge, may judge, that the reaſon why our condition is thus at preſent is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe we are many wayes diſcontented one with another, in reference to that which is paſt on all ſides: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe there is no agreement amongſt us, about the way of future ſettlement, in expectation of what is to come: and whatever any may think, or hope upon ſpirituall grounds, concerning the event of theſe evils: (wherof I can entertain, I bleſſe God, as great hopes as any,) yet ſure it is,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:163962:36"/> that none can look with the eye of a Chriſtian upon our preſent condition, referring it unto God; but he muſt confeſſe that we are under a viſible judgement, which may as well end in our utter deſtruction, if God in mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not; as in a happy ſettlement, nor can any rationall man be ſo ſenceleſſe, as not to perceive this to be a Truth: nor is it credible that any true Chriſtian will be ſo ſtupid, as not to lay this Truth to heart.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>And our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in before God to make it our happineſſe.</head>
                  <p>If then, in this caſe of dangerous unſettlement, wherein the Maſter-builders are at variance, and moſt that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, ſeeme willing rather to pull down what others have built; then by counſell to uphold joyntly what ought to be ſetled, (which is a ſad preſage,) we ſhould every one ſeriouſly conſider what becometh us in our places: leſt we be given over to delight in each others deſtruction, let us reflect upon our wayes, and order our behaviour rightly therein towards God and men; that upon the diſcoverie of that which is a miſſe, we may henceforth labour to make them ſuch as beſeems Chriſtians. For if we ſet our ſelves to murmure at the changeableneſſe of humane affaires, this is nothing elſe but to controul Gods counſell, whereby he hath appointed that to be one of the ſpeciall meanes of our felicitie: if we murmure and fight againſt the afflictions, which our outward man muſt ſuffer under theſe changes: this is nothing elſe, but to kick againſt the pricks, and to ſtrive in vain againſt the unalterable law of nature: and if we ſet our ſelves to diſcover, and condemn the faults of other men under theſe changes, to trouble our ſelves and others at the ſuppoſed cauſes thereof, rather then to finde out a way to redreſſe the ſame, this is nothing elſe but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſſe and madneſſe: but if in all theſe trialls and changes, we ſtudie the conſtant and equall rule of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to order our wayes therein before God and men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, this is that, which will make us truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in all our unſetlements: for as concerning the ſtate, wherein at the preſent we are, (ſeeing it is evident that God by an extraordinary hand of judgement hath caſt us into it) as it is now unavoidable, ſo to be under the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:163962:36"/> thereof, is not to be counted our ſinne, but rather our triall; and through the lot of our affliction, the way to a bleſſing, if we behave our ſelves as Chriſtians ought to do therein. For if all the good or evil, of every outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to us, doth wholly depend upon the frame of our ſpirit, and upon the way of our behaviour before God therin; then it doth follow, that according to our ſpirituall temper or diſtemper, and our orderly or diſorderly carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this condition, the event thereof will be our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or our miſerie; for if our ſpirits are diſtempered, and our courſe diſordered againſt the rule of our profeſſion, it is evident that this will redouble the evill of our affliction, inwardly and outwardly, making it both wayes ſinfull, and thereby miſerable: but if our outward changes take us not off from the way of Chriſtianity, which is unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, we have juſt cauſe to beleeve, that by the increaſe of vertue and grace, they will become our onely happineſſe, becauſe we have a promiſe, that in all theſe things <hi>we ſhall be more then conquerours through him that loveth us:</hi> Rom. 8. 37.

And leſt by theſe means we may be deprived of our comforts, and loſe the fruit of our labours which are undertaken for the reparation of that which is laid waſte among us; let us point at the chief diſtempers and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which obſtruct our work, that they may be removed, and the courſe ſutable to the Rules of our holy profeſſion, heretofore ſet down, ſeriouſly taken up, and ſincerely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>I have already given you my ſenſe of ſeverall diſtempers and diſorderly carriages of ſome particular men, in their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:163962:37"/> diſtinct wayes, which have a ſpeciall influence upon our ſpirituall affairs, to make us, as the confuſed builders of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, the authors of our own diſſipation and ruine: I ſhall now mention a few diſorderly courſes, which are incident unto all men more or leſſe, and ſeeme to diſcompoſe the healthfull conſtitution of our whole ſocietie, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of all outward affaires: and here, although I am not ignorant, that the diſtemper of the ſpirit, and the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the behaviour are things very farre diſtant in their nature, and diſtinct in their properties: yet becauſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of outward concernment they are ſeldome ſeparate, and going hand in hand, they beget interchangably and are begotten by each other; therefore, and for brevities ſake, I ſhall not heed their diſtinction at this time; but leave it to every ones thought in that which I ſhall offer: here then let me ſpeak of the diſtemper and diſorderlineſſe proceeding from theſe following roots of bitterneſſe, viz: from <hi>envie,</hi> from <hi>jealouſies and fears;</hi> from <hi>tale bearing and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate cenſuring;</hi> &amp; from <hi>revenge,</hi> which I conceive to be the chief cauſes of our preſent diſeaſes: and of all theſe this is to be ſaid in the generall, that as no man can exempt himſelf from the danger of theſe ſinfull motions, ſo thoſe that are moſt remarkably engaged either by their places or proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the management of publick affaires, are moſt lyable to the temptations thereof, which are ſo much the more hurtfull to the Societies of mankind, by how much the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon whom they ſeize are found more eminent in parts or places: and the affaires upon which they reflect are more important; and by how much the complication of theſe diſtempers in thoſe that are acted by them is more powerfull, leſſe corrigible, and leſſe diſcernable.</p>

For he ſaith, the ſpirit doth luſt to envie: that is, deſires to fulfill the motions of envie; if then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our envy, be the end of our luſting, envie is the root whence luſt proceeds: for in the immediate end of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing the principle of the being thereof is to be found.</p>
                        <p>2. That the Spirit which dwelleth in the Saints, doth not luſt to envie.</p>
                        <p>For the aſſertion in it ſelf is clear and undeniable; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:163962:38"/> that in the Apoſtles words it is intended, is evident by the adverſative Particle of the following words, which joyneth them unto the latter end of the 5. verſe, and the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and coherence of the matter doth evince, that in the 5. verſe there muſt be inſtead of one (which in our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſlation is expreſſed) a double interrogation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the latter muſt run in this ſenſe. Doth the Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us luſt to envie? as if he had ſaid, by no means.</p>
                        <p>3. That the Spirit which is in the friends of the world doth luſt to envy.</p>
                        <p>For it is clear, that all worldlings are bent to luſt, after that which they would have, ſo as that they envy others to have it it beſides themſelves: and that is the thing, which the Apoſtle here doth preſuppoſe, whereupon the queſtion, denying it to befall unto the ſpirit which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Saints, is raiſed. We muſt obſerve then, that as the Spirit of God, and the ſpirit of the world are oppoſite, ſo their luſts tend to different ends, and what is denyed of the one, is affirmed of the other: Whence we muſt further obſerve, that the corruption and infection of our ſpirit in nature; making our luſt diſorderly and contentious, is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ſelf-love, as it taketh us off from the love of our neighbour: that is, as it perverteth our intention from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that he may partake of that good which we wiſh for our ſelves; for ſelf-love is not otherwiſe vicious, but as it confineth our intentions within our ſelves alone. It is no ſin to love ones ſelf, if we love our neighbour as our ſelf.</p>

                        <p>We cannot then but ſee, that God hath permitted him, in whoſe hand before theſe troubles the chief truſt of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power was, to be deprived of the ſame; and by what means this is come to paſſe, is apparent unto all: for firſt the management of affairs which he uſed, being judged very prejudiciall to the ſafetie of the State by thoſe, unto whom the publick Reformation thereof was intruſted: it then fell out, that the truſt of Government and Power, was devolved by degrees, upon thoſe whom God did ſuffer in their places to act againſt him. How this fell out, I think none can be ignorant, who hath been able to obſerve any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:163962:39"/> thing. For after that God had ſet up thoſe, who acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in their places, by a right which the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conferred upon them, to ſit as long as they thought fit, to manage their truſt; after that they were engaged by the Law of Nature to act for their own ſafetie, by the Power and Authority which they had in their hand, and after that their whole management of power became without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane contrivances by Gods ſupreme conduct, as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſucceſſefull for their advantage, as their adverſaries management became with all humane contrivances, unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull for their diſadvantage; it pleaſed him, who doth all things according to the counſell of his own will, ſo to change the Government, that from one intruſted in chief, it fell into the hands of many, and that it became a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not of a free tranſaction, but of prevailing power; unto the rule whereof, the truſt of governing was on all ſides given up &amp; committed, by the drawing of the Sword. After (I ſay) that theſe things by degrees happened thus, it fell out amongſt thoſe many, into whoſe hands the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs did fall (as naturally it needs muſt amongſt thoſe that think themſelves equall one to another, when they take up different intereſts) that none would yeeld the priviledge of pre-eminencie unto his neighbour: but every one did ſtrive to get poſſeſſion of it for himſelf. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, as formerly the King had loſt his hold of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for want of power, ſo that party which without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hold of power would have ſetled the Government by his means, with reference to ſome of his deſires; and againſt the ſenſe of the powerfull party, hath for his ſake, and for the neceſſitie where into the powerfull party thought it ſelf, the whole cauſe it had proſecuted, and the ſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, reduced, loſt the place which it had in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and is now made ſubordinate unto the party which hath prevailed.</p>
                        <p>Thus all along the object of ſtrife hath been the truſt of power and government; and the pre-eminencie in this truſt hath been the object of envy, and is ſtill in the ſpirits of thoſe who are paſſionately moved either at, or about, the change of outward affairs.</p>

                        <p>Now the ſpirit of envy doth work ordinarily upon us, when we finde our ſelves in want of ſome thing which we deſire, and others in poſſeſſion thereof, whom we love not. And it is hardly to be determined, whether the grief for ones own want of that which is deſired, or the enjoyment thereof by others that are hated, be the greater vexation to an envious ſpirit; nor can it otherwiſe be determined, but by the diſcoverie of two other paſſionate diſtempers, Pride and Hatred, whereof this evill humour is made up, and wherewith it is from time to time fermented to fall into its paroxiſmes. For if pride be predominant, then the fit of our vexation is more for our own want, then for others enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but if hatred be predominant, then we are more vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that another hath it, then that we do want it: and this makes an envious man, when he is out of hope to gain what he would have for himſelf, to bend his thoughts, that it ſhould be transferred rather to any other hand whatſoever, then that it ſhould remain with him that hath it, nor doth he think any thing unjuſt which may bring this to paſſe, though it be unto others never ſo grievous and injurious: and when he can neither gain it to himſelf, nor transfer it to another, his laſt endevour will be to ſpoil it, and make it miſcarrie in the hand of him that hath it: as in the Goſpel<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 25.</note> parable, the Enemy that ſowed tares among the good wheat, did it, becauſe he envied him, to whom the wheat did belong: So do all thoſe that make no conſcience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct good and lawfull enterpriſes; onely becauſe they are ſet afoot by thoſe whom they affect not, or whom they envy to have the honour of doing that which is commendable. And how far upon thoſe diſtempers this kinde of diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe hath broke forth from time to time, or ſtill doth reign in the ſpirits of ſome of us, and who have been the chief actors for Satan therein, I ſhall not make my ſelf a Judge.

                        <p>State Jealouſies and Fears go hand in hand; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get reciprocally each other, and are begotten of each other;

Thoſe reflect upon the counſels, theſe upon the actions of men, and upon the events of buſineſſes. Now the difference between envy and jealouſie is this; that we envy thoſe whom we love not, becauſe they enjoy the good which we want: but we are jealous over thoſe whom we are obliged to love, leſt we be deprived by them of that which we pretend to poſſeſſe. This paſſion may be harmleſſe, if the love upon which it is grounded be pure; but if pride doth mix it ſelf therewith, then we are jealouſly affected towards others, but<note place="margin">Gal 4. 17. with Gal. 6. 13.</note> not well, as the Apoſtle terms it: becauſe it maketh us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exclude others from that which is their advantage and priviledge, that they may be brought under our power to affect us; and that we may glory over them.</p>

                        <p>Now therefore there may and ought to be in Magiſtrates and Miniſters a commendable, and lawfull jealouſie and fear, which is for the good of the ſocietie over which they are ſet: this is a prudentiall care to watch for the good, and prevent the evill, which may befall to thoſe whom they love, and over whom they are ſet. Thus the Apoſtle was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly affected towards the Corinthians: <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over you with godly jealouſie; for I have eſpouſed you to one huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that I may preſent you as a chaſt virgin to Chriſt: but I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 2. 3.

But leſt they ſhould loſe ſomewhat of their neerneſſe towards God, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt in Chriſt be leſſened. And according to this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:163962:41"/> not onely Miniſters, but faithfull Magiſtrates ought to be prudentially watchfull, and jealouſly fearfull, not ſo much for their own intereſt in the affections of thoſe that are under them, leſt they ſeem to be leſſened therein; but for the good, and advantage of thoſe that God hath committed unto their charge; leſt they come ſhort of that felicitie which they are bound to procure unto them.

For if he doth love them, and is faithfull to the truſt committed by God unto him for them, he will wholly quit this of his own, for the purchaſe of that unto them, chiefly when otherwiſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained: and this he ought to do, becauſe he is bound to know, that God hath ſet him in his place for the good of the people, and not made or given up the people to the pleaſure of his will, and meerly for him to be a Ruler over them; the Court flattery which hath darkned this truth, hath cauſed the Leaders of the Nations to erre, and deſtroyed the way of their paths. For the great ones that have power in the world, being flattered into pride and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and forgetting that they are ſervants of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie for the publick good thereof, make uſe of their places, and abuſe their truſt, to ſatisfie private paſſions; they look upon all men, and things as made to ſerve their wils; and whatſoever is not ſubordinate unto the way of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and greatneſſe, wherein they delight to appear above others, is made an object of their jealouſie and ſuſpition; as if all that are not ſlaves unto their appetites, were oppoſites unto, or competitors of their greatnes. When this imaginary ſuſpitiouſnes hath put the ſpirits of thoſe that are in ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy out of frame, they pervert the courſe of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſetting themſelves rather to vex and grieve thoſe that diſagree from their ſenſe in any thing (onely becauſe they go not their way, to humour them in all things; though they be otherwiſe harmleſſe and quiet in the Land) then to

                           <p>Gods way of dealing towards us, is conſidered as he is Liberall, Juſt, and Mercifull towards us v. 6. <hi>But he gives more grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</hi>

                              <p>And the devil is ſaid to flie from us, when being foiled in theſe attempts, he doth leave off to provoke us thereunto: which doth fall out aſſoon as his ſuggeſtions are diſcovered, and we armed with a reſolution not to yeeld unto the ſame. For all the advantage which he hath againſt us in times of affliction to lead us into temptation, is the unſetled and troubled frame of ſpirit wherein he finds us: for when Gods hand is upon us, and we do not give up our wils in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto his will, but fret and murmure at the things which do befall unto us; then Satan can take hold of us, and we have no power to reſiſt him, by reaſon of our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; but aſſoon as we give up our turbulent affections as a ſacrifice unto the will of God, by ſubmiſſion thereunto; and deny our ſelves that his diſpenſation may take place, as well in our will, as over our outward man: Satan is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his hold, becauſe when we are contented with Gods diſpenſation, the love of God is ſhed abroad in our heart, which begetteth hope, and ſtrengthneth our faith in the promiſes; and by this means all the devils fierie darts are quenched. Now when he finds a ſoul thus armed, and in a poſture of defence, he never aſſaults further, but as a proud coward, is afraid to be ſhamed, and flies from us. Satan deals with the ſouls of men, as <hi>Amaleck</hi> did with Iſrael when<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 17, 18.</note> they came out of Aegypt, he lyes in wait in the way, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults our hindmoſt parts where we are weakeſt, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his opportunity both to come behinde us, and alſo to finde us in a faint and wearie condition: he dares not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our face when we are in a poſture of defence; but he is gone as ſoon as he finds himſelf diſcovered, and we ſet our face againſt him: now we never turn our face againſt him, but when we turn it by ſubmiſſion unto God, to reſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſſe in his will, as in that which alone is moſt perfect, good and acceptable. This then is the onely Remedie of all

For by his drawing nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, we become partaker of his vertue and nature, which alters our inclinations. Here then the Apoſtle doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that when the ſoul is under the triall of a temptation, it doth put it ſelf at a diſtance from God, and that Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not with it: for if he were preſent with it, Satan could neither appear, nor prevail againſt it: but now our naturall inclinations being to wander, and go aſtray from him, (as it is written, <hi>Hebr. 3. 10. They erre alwayes in their heart, and have not known my wayes,</hi>) therefore Satan doth find the ſoul as a loſt ſheep out of the way, and is readie, if God ſhould not reſtrain him, to devour it: for whiles we are at a diſtance from God, we neither are, nor indeed can we be, ſubject to his wil; and conſequently cannot with ſubmiſſion accept of his diſpenſation over us. That therefore we may be brought about to ſubmit our wils unto Gods will, and by that means reſiſt the devil, who dwels in the turbulencie of our envious ſpirit; we are exhorted and inſtructed to draw nigh unto God in our ſpirits, that he may meet us, and draw nigh unto us by his Spirit.</p>
                              <p>We draw nigh unto God, when we come to Chriſt in the Spirit of prayer and faith, to be reconciled to the Father, by the redemption which is in him, and to be united to him through the covenant, that we may live by his word.

                              <p>And God doth draw nigh to us, when for Chriſts ſake he doth accept of us graciouſly, and teſtifieth his acceptance of us by the ſpirit of Adoption, by which he beareth witneſſe to our ſpirits that we are the Sons of God; and by which he ſheddeth abroad his love in our hearts, ſealing us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, untill the day of our Redemption. To draw nigh therefore unto God is in a word, when we want his preſence to call upon his name as our Father in Chriſt, knowing that whatſoever we ask in his name ſhall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for Chriſt hath ſaid that he will do it: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 13.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:163962:49"/> by which this guilt is to be wiped away, muſt relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both theſe, that every thing amiſſe may be righted in that whence the evill doth proceed; and ſo the cauſes of our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all reſpects removed. Now the iniquity of our courſe is twofold, the one is outward, the other inward; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defilements of the fleſh going along with all our naturall actions, bring us under the guilt of the Law: and to free us from this, the Apoſtle enjoyns us, to <hi>cleanſe our hands from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, ver.</hi> 8. but the inward pollutions are from the heart, when it is deſtitute of Faith, and ſincerity towards God and man; and to remedy this, the Apoſtle enjoyns us, <hi>to purifie our hearts from double-mindednes, ver.</hi> 8. The diſhonour done to God by the iniquity of our courſe, doth make us liable to wrath in reſpect of the Supream Majeſty, which by our offence is made void; and to free us from this part of the guilt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle enjoynes godly ſorrow in the inward affections, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour ſutable thereunto in the outward expreſſions.

                              <p>The proper effect of guiltines, is to keep us back from the preſence of God, and deprive us of the freedom of ſpirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot draw neer unto him; this is by theſe meanes taken away, and we are fitted by the ſincerity of true Repentance, both to come with boldneſſe to the Throne of<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> Grace, and alſo to obtaine Mercy, and finde Grace to help our miſery in time of need; Not that our acts of Repentance are any ſatisfaction unto Gods Juſtice for our ſins by-paſt; that is, for the uncleaneſſe practiſed, and the ſpots contracted upon our ſouls, which is our miſery, or for the Orders and Rules of righteouſnes broken, and diſturbed by us in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is our rebellion; and for the wrongs and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to the name of God thereby, which is our Treaſon;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:163962:50"/> as if he ſhould in conſideration of the worth of ſuch perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as done by us, remit the guilt which we have incurred; and account ſuch actions a compenſation for the ſame. No, that is not the Apoſtles meaning, in preſcribing theſe Duties, nor my ſcope in preſſing the practiſe thereof, as a cure to our ſpirituall diſtempers; but the Apoſtles meaning and my ſcope is, to ſhew that by theſe performances ſome new qualifications of the ſoul, &amp; alterations of the frame of the Spirit are wrought in believers, to fit them to the enjoyment of that which doth actually free them, from all guilt both in Gods account and in their own Conſcience: For by theſe meanes our ſouls are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to become ſuſceptible of the Grace which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us; for whoſe ſake alone, we are delivered from the guilt of wrath in the Fathers account, and the frame of our ſpirit is altered, to inable us to perceive the remiſſion of the guilt, by the teſtimony of the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and finde effectually, that God is in Chriſt reconciling us unto himſelf, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting unto us our ſins for his ſake. I ſay, theſe acts of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and our performance of the ſame, are neceſſary meanes to take away the guilt of our ſinfullnes; not as to the Juſtice of God, (for that is Chriſts work through the Redemption in his blood) but as to the qualification and frame of our ſpirit, to make it ſuſceptible, and ſenſible of the Redemption which is in the hand of Chriſt, to be applyed unto every one, who by the conviction of his Conſcience is drawn over, and doth yeeld himſelf obedient unto God in theſe duties; For as long as we are impenitent and hardened in our way, through the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling deceitfulnes of ſin, we remain under the guilt of wrath, and can have no confidence in God through Chriſt, becauſe the Promiſes are made unto none, but unto thoſe that repent, and believe in the Goſpel; but when we change our courſe, or are rather changed in our courſe, upon the change of our minde with a new frame of heart towards God, then the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which is to fear is removed, and the free Spirit of Chriſt which teſtifieth unto our ſpirit our Adoption, is given to us: for till this be done, the ſpirit of bondage doth ſtand with a flaming Sword between us, and the way of the tree of life in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:163962:50"/> Paradiſe: that is, between our ſoul and the Covenant of life in Chriſt by the Peace of a good Conſcience. Now the flaming Sword ſtanding between us and the way to this tree, is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Gods wrath, as it is due to ſin, and of our owne guilt, as we are liable to wrath and under ſin; it is then in this ſenſe, and by the diſpenſation of the grace of Repentance to this effect, that the guilt is taken away, and reſt is given to the wearied ſoul.</p>

                              <p>1.

                              <p>2.

                              <p>3. In reſpect of other men he ſets us up, when he gives us a due place of love, and eſteeme in the thoughts of the beſt of them, and makes his vertues by us manifeſt in the ſight of all the reſt; ſo that they cannot but ſee his glory.</p>
                              <p>Theſe favours are attainable at Gods hand, but the way to attaine them is to become lowly as in the ſight of God; that is, as looking upon God and minding our ſubordination unto him in all things, we ſhould unfeinedly eſteeme our ſelves, as of our ſelves, to be nothing; whether we reflect upon our ſtate in Grace with reference unto God, or upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings amongſt men, or upon our abilities to performe the ſame: For in theſe three things our ſpirituall &amp; naturall pride doth commonly break forth: and if herein we receive Grace truly to deny our ſelves in Gods ſight, and to be nothing in our ſelves; the promiſe is, that we ſhall be lift up: here then the rule of humility is to be obſerved.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:163962:51"/> ſpirits by the teſtimony of Jeſus, nor is it poſſible to work for every one, to make the application of theſe Remedies unto himſelf; yet in a more ſpeciall manner the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould hold forth theſe teſtimonies by their own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe unto others; and by their word of Exhortation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, chiefly when it is their Lot (as now it is mine) to reflect upon the waies of men, wherein a competition of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth appear; and for this cauſe I have been ſomewhat larger and freer, as ſpeaking to a matter, which is neceſſary to be laid to heart by all at this time: which is moſt fit, to lay the ground of Peaceablenes and Moderation amongſt Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and which is moſt ſutable to my aime and deſigne, which is to ſeek out, and hold forth the Rules of Truth in Love, without partiality towards all men. And would to God that all our debates could be brought to diſquiries of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at leaſt amongſt thoſe that are called Miniſters: For if they who are ſo called, and think themſelves profeſſedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to go before others, and to lead them in the waies of Chriſtianity; do neither mind the offering of undeniable Rules unto all, nor ſet themſelves to walk in the light thereof. How can it be expected that they ſhould be healers, or that they whoſe engagements lie wholly about the affaires of the World, ſhould be moved either affectionately to mind, or effectually to follow the ſame? We that are made remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers of others, ſhould firſt mind our ſelves of theſe Duties; but if in ſtead of reclaiming others from the paſſions of fleſh and blood in the World, we our ſelves intermeddle with State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affaires; if out of the way of our calling, we make our ſelves in any kind competitors with the Magiſtrate in his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards the people, and ſo caſt our ſelves upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which yeild temptations unto Envy &amp; Pride, and into the ſnares of outward affaires; How can we take others off from their diſtempers of this nature? How can we ſet them right in aſpirituall way? We may find eaſily, as well by reaſon of our own frailty: as by the ſubtilty of Satan our adverſary, that more objects and occaſions of mutuall envy, are ſuggeſted unto us within the Sphere of our own employment, then we are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:163962:52"/> well able to decline: Why then ſhould we take up extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters, and ferment our own ſpirits with the thoughts of State-Envy, or foment the ſame in the apprehenſions of any one againſt another? Is it not our proper work to allay and ſuppreſſe all the motions of this kind, in every one? Is not this moſt ſutable to the employment of the Meſſengers of the Prince of Peace? And doth not Chriſt expect at our hand, that our whole work in his ſervice ſhould be nothing elſe, but to Teach, Exhort and perſwade all men, to preſent themſelves as a living ſacrifice unto him, in following his foot-ſteps: that is, denying ungodlines &amp; worldly luſts, to live ſoberly, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and godly in this preſent World? And if this be all our work, how ſhall we anſwer unto him for our inter-medling with other matters, wherein we take upon us to rule the intereſts of this World; and to walk as men, in ſerving the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men therein? But I am loath to inſiſt any longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Theme. The Lord grant that all Chriſtians may ſee the depth of Satans wiles in this matter of Envy, to avoid his ſnares; and that above all men, Miniſters and Magiſtrates may be faithfull to Chriſt in their Stewardſhips, <hi>without deſire</hi>

But here alas it my be ſayd, <hi>Medice cura teipſum;</hi> we muſt firſt return to theſe duties our ſelves, and learn to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them before we can practice them, or teach them unto others.

Here indeed is the reſt wherewith we may cauſe the weary to reſt, &amp; this is the refreſhing: But who ſhall make men willing to hearken to it?

                           <p>Thirdly, let us conſider this truth, that to relate the faults and errors of one man who is a ſtranger to another, under the pretence of warning him to whom the relation is made of the danger thereof, is neither charitable nor poſitively edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, it is not charitable becauſe the diſcoveries of mans fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to ſtrangers, can proceed from no love to thoſe that faile, for love covereth from ſtrangers a multitude of ſins; nor can it work any love in ſtrangers towards them, nor is it poſſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly edifying to thoſe that are made acquainted therewith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:163962:55"/> nothing doth poſitively edifie, but the manifeſtation of Truth and Righteouſnes,</p>
                           <p>Fourthly and laſtly, let this Rule be laid to heart, that to lay open the faults of any, either to himſelf or to others; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then in order to the courſe which Chriſt hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to rectifie the ſame; and with a charitable deſign, to bring him that erreth from the error of his way, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and therefore none ought to cenſure any man or fault; but that at the ſame inſtant, is able and willing to ſhew the way how to reclaim the man, and redreſſe the fault.</p>

                     <p>And thus much concerning the ſingle and diſtinct Remedies which every one in private for himſelf is to make uſe of; now it remaineth, to ſpeak alſo ſomething of the univerſal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated remedies, which all of us with reference one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould ſeeke to apply unto our diſtracted publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to heale the diſtempers which occaſion the ſame, and although all are obliged to deſire and endeavour in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the advancement hereof towards the publick; yet proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the procurement and the application thereof doth belong mainly to the Miniſtery, to the Magiſtracy in their ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that with a ſpecial Reference to each other in their publick Adminiſtrations towards the Communalty.</p>
                     <p>As then the complication of our diſtempers, doth beget an univerſal diſeaſe, both in Religious and Civil Affaires: So the general Remedies which flow from the fundamental du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Love, of Righteouſnes, and of Peaceablenes, ought in a way of concurrence to be applyed, both to the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Now the Miniſters of the Goſpel are Meſſengers of Gods
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:163962:56"/> Love, and the Governours of the State are Miniſters of his Righteouſnes unto all men; and both theſe as well in reſpect of their particular imployments, as in reſpect of the common Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, are called by God, both unto the enjoyment of peace for themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 15.

                     <p>And again, as nothing is truly love which doth not tend to a real good of him who is the object thereof; or is not intended as a real good towards the object, by him who is the Author thereof: So nothing can be counted, or will ever be found a real good, or is intended for ſuch unto any, which is neither applyed nor intended as from God.</p>

                        <p>That if any Miniſter of the Goſpel, doth at any time take upon him to be a judge of the Affaires of this world, between Man and Man, about which they are commonly in ſtrife, and therein doth take part with the one, and oppoſeth the other; as an Agent of the Affaires of this world: and doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and mainly, by raiſing their ſpirits above earthly paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by leading them to the life of Chriſt, endeavour to allay their worldly affections, to compoſe their differences; and to reconcile their affections one to another, in the love of Chriſt: if (I ſay) any Miniſter doth not ſet himſelf to work thus, when he is obliged to meddle with carnal controverſies, about the things of men; he hath clearly renounced not only the work of a true Miniſter of the Goſpel, but the name alſo of a true Chriſtian: for there can be no earthly concernment of ſuch importance, or ſo near to a Chriſtian, as to engage him to forge and caſt off the duties and the affections of divine love towards any, or not to endeavour the common welfare of all without partiality, as Chriſt hath loved us, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our welfare: if therefore any be found, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">The ſnare wherein ſome Miniſters are caught, which doth hinder them from apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> Miniſters, and yet make themſelves on all ſides the chief Actors and Abettors of State differences and controverſies; by whoſe inſtigation under a pretence of Religion, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of men are heightned, and the common welfare of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocieties is diſturbed, ſhall we call them herein Miniſters of the Goſpel of God? ſhall we ſay, that in ſo doing they are guiltleſs before men? or ſhall we not rather ſay, that they are quite out of their way, that they are Miniſters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:163962:57"/> of Satan by following their own humours, and that the Lord by them doth mingle a perverſe ſpirit amongſt the unſound profeſſors of Chriſtianity. I do not think or ſay, that all Miniſters on all ſides are thus ſet, or ſet themſelves a work (for that would be a great untruth) nor do I take upon me to judge any in particular, or to judge in generall of all thoſe that take upon them to meddle in State Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they do it againſt the Dictates of their Conſcience (for that would be a preſumptuous and uncharitable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but this I ſay, and judge, that ſo many of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as are thus ſet, and do meddle (as they ſuppoſe by an engagement of Conſcience) with State Matters, to take part with one, and oppoſe another party therein, and do not ſtudie directly to take off the edge of all mens carnall animoſities, by the love of Chriſt, that all may be directed to build up one another, in all truth and righteouſneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the kingdome of God. I ſay, ſo many of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as take this courſe, (let it be upon what pretence ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) are in a manifeſt error, and dangerous ſnare of Satan; from which, I ſhall intreat the Lord in mercie to deliver them. And that I may not be wanting to my duty and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to help them out of it, (according to that rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>Whoſoever cenſures any fault, ought to ſhew the way how it ſhould be redreſſed</hi>) I ſhall in the meaſure which I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hold forth, and demonſtrate the courſe, by which, in theſe our preſent diſtractions, the Miniſters, who truly mind the work of the Goſpel, ſhould walk towards all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, to avoid this ſnare of Satan.</p>
                        <p>And to this effect, I ſhall take this for granted; that the Miniſteriall employment in the Goſpel is nothing elſe but a ſtewardſhip, wherunto the diſpenſation of the meſſages and myſteries of Gods love to mankind in and by Chriſt Jeſus<note place="margin">The way to recover them out of the ſnare.</note> is committed: and that conſequently all the acts of this ſtewardſhip, muſt at all times anſwer the nature and end of this diſpenſation; or if any thing anſwer it not, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the love of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:163962:58"/> to God, and unwarrantable as to men. Upon which ground this doth manifeſtly follow, that no faithfull Miniſter of the Goſpell will dare to do or ſay any thing miniſterially concerning our preſent diſtractions in the State, but that vvhich the love of God in Chriſt doth direct him to do, and doth prompt him to ſay, as a Chriſtian, unto Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or unto ſuch as pretend to be the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. Which can be effectually nothing elſe; but that which is fit to incline through the love of God the heart of every one, to put on towards each other the bowels of mercy, of compaſſion, of kindeneſſe, of meekneſſe, and of long ſuffering, that the breaches which make us unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one to another in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity may be healed by the unity of the Spirit of Chriſt in the bond of peace. For if all our works and our perſwaſions center not in Gods love, upon the hearts of thoſe with whom we deal, through the unfeigned profeſſion of Chriſtianity; it is certain that we will venture upon them in the love of this preſent world for ſomething which doth oblige us to the profeſſion of partialitie: for ſo farre as we go out of the one way, we ſtep immediately into the other, therefore to keep our ſelves free from the trappes wherein many are caught, by the ſubtile contrivances of State Myſteries; and to help thoſe that are recoverable, to recover themſelves out of the engagement to further breaches, and to prevent the great thoughts of heart which our deſtructive diviſions are like to bring forth: Let us reflect as in the ſight of God upon the Rules of our Chriſtian duties, firſt in love, and then in righteouſneſſe, and in peaceableneſſe; that ſo many of us, as make not the pretence of Religion and conſcience, a cloak of maliciouſneſſe; but in all things and above all, endeavour without partialitie towards men, to approve our conſcience in ſinceritie before God; may finde a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by the ſpirit, in the word of Truth, which is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, whereby to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

From this faintneſſe of ſpirit which was upon the Hebrews in undertaking the works of their profeſſion, and the inequalitie of their wayes in proſecuting that which they did undertake, did ariſe ſtrife and debate: and with it much uncleanneſſe and defilements of the fleſh and ſpirit; which naturally go along with variance. We are here in the ſame caſe, for on the one hand our want of true zeale and forwardneſſe in neceſſary duties; on the other, the crooked and perverſe courſes which we have followed, have multiplied matters of private and publick quarrels amongſt us: and theſe have been fruitfull in manifold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, wherein our corruptions have mightily broke forth, and manifeſted the uncleanneſſe which is in us.</p>
                           <p>4. The Hebrews by reaſon of their ſtrivings, and of the defilements following thereupon, were under a threefold danger: Firſt, that amongſt them there might be a falling away from the grace of God: that is from the ſaving truth which they had received. Secondly, that upon their defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a root of bitterneſſe might ſpring up and defile many. Thirdly, that amongſt ſuch as might be defiled, fornicators, and profane perſons (ſuch as <hi>Eſau</hi> was) might be found. Now to us, all theſe dangerous evils are befallen, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of our filthineſſe in our quarrels. For it is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that although the grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath been more powerfully revealed unto this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then unto any in the world, ſince the diſcoverie of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; yet it is as fully apparent as any thing can be, that amongſt us now, there is a more apparent defection of many from the grace which we have received, then amongſt any that have attempted a Reformation in theſe latter times. So the firſt thing whereof they were in danger is come effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually upon us: As for the ſecond, would to God that there were but one root of bitterneſſe ſprung up amongſt us; but alas, there are ſo many, that they can hardly be named; and they have defiled ſo many, that they cannot be numbered.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:163962:60"/> Inſtead of acknowledging God to be the onely true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent; a root of bitterneſſe is ſprung up, whereby men do Deifie themſelves: inſtead of the holy Scriptures, they make their own reaſon or fancie a rule of truth: and inſtead of Ordinances of holy worſhip; they reſt upon the pretence of the ſpirit and the private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof to enjoy God. Some inſtead of Repentance and Faith, and the exerciſe of all vertues; maintain, that the practiſe of all vices is the onely way to happineſſe: and ſome inſtead of denying themſelves in the world, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the ſuperiour powers which God hath ſet over them therein, maintain, that all government is to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and that the right to poſſeſſe all things doth belong to none but unto themſelves. And becauſe theſe defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have ſpread themſelves in the hearts of many, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt of the evils, whereof the Hebrews are warned, is come upon us in full meaſure: for there be ſwarmes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, of Atheiſts, and profane perſons like <hi>Eſau,</hi> which ſhew themſelves openly amongſt us and ſhameleſly: which ſads the hearts of all the godly.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee, that in every thing there is a dolefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between our preſent State, and that condition whereinto the Apoſtle found the Hebrews either already fallen, or like to fall, to the diſhonour of God, to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Goſpell, and the great prejudice of their own ſalvation.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:163962:60"/> repreſent evils ſuffered on the one ſide, and injuries done on the other, is the method to foment bitterneſſe, hatred, wrath, clamour, and evil ſpeaking, which we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all times to put away from us; but ſhould then do chiefly, when we are about a way to cure diſtempers, and heale publick evils: for this way is ſo farre from reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any from his violent affections, that it tends rather not onely to diſhearten the well affected even in lawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, when they ſee evils hainouſly aggravated, againſt thoſe to whom they faine would do good; but it alſo helps to increaſe our diviſions, by renewing matters of diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ought to be forgotten.

If then either as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians we are bound to provoke one another unto love, and to good works, or as meſſengers of Gods loving kindneſſe unto mankind, we are obliged to ſeek the love of all men to each other in him; it cannot be denied, but that a main part of the Miniſteriall work is, to ſeek and maintain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love amongſt men, and to do this, it is evident, that a chief preparative will be, to perſwade all men, not to inſiſt upon the repetition of former offenſive matters (which are paſt remedies, as being tranſient acts) but to cover mutually each others tranſgreſſions, even as we would deſire God to cover our ſins in Jeſus Chriſt: And if will needs lay open<note place="margin" type="runSum">Where of the Remedie is ſhewed.</note> matters of grief, let it onely be, either to obſerve them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently, to make confeſſion thereof and to lament over them, till God have mercy upon us; or prudently to uſe cautions for the publick, to prevent the cauſes of future di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances; that none may wilfully return again to folly. All the ſatisfaction which God requires of us men, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faults, though never ſo hainous, is this, that we ſhould in after times <hi>ceaſe to do evil and learn to do good.</hi> And if we do<note place="margin">Iſa. 1, 16 17.</note> ſo, all our tranſgreſſions, though formerly like unto Scarlet; yet then they ſhall be as ſnow in his account: and they ſhall not be mentioned unto us any more, ſaith the prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Chap. 18. ver. 22. This therefore ought to be in like manner our way of love; and the healing of evils, which

                           <p>This Direction then hath a Poſitive and a Negative part of Dutie for our cure.</p>

She having lived at her eaſe in <hi>Sodome,</hi> when ſhe was to flee for her life out of it, was forbidden to look back; leſt ſhe ſhould grieve at the judgement of God, when ſhe ſhould ſee all the objects of her ſenſuall delights, burnt up thereby at once. Now becauſe ſhe obeyed not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lord, but fixed her Imagination (as many do now amongſt us) backward, and went not forward in her heart to the place of her reſt and ſafetie, which the Lord had appointed her, therefore he made her to be a pillar of ſalt, with her body turned this way, and with her face looking that way, neither going backward nor forward, but ſtanding ſtill in the mid way, that ſhe ſhould remain as an example of a ſpeciall puniſhment which is due to thoſe, who in their hearts controul the paſt judgements of God, and which is inflicted, by fixing their ſpirits, in that uſeleſſe poſture, wherein they ſet themſelves, by looking back upon the remembrance of their loſt enjoyments. Let us therefore beware of remembring things paſt in ſuch a way, leſt we be made like to her.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond ſort of theſe that look backward upon their ſuffrings are like unto the dogs, who when a ſtone is caſt at them, though flung beyond them, yet they will run back to bite at it; for theſe upon the conſideration of things paſt, though now beyond them, yet they whet their affections with malice, envy and revenge, and their tongues with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words againſt the inſtruments of Gods judgements over them. The puniſhment of theſe men is likewiſe as their fault is: their ſpirits are fixed in the reſtleſneſſe of their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:163962:62"/> condition; for the wicked ſhall have no peace, ſaith my God, but as the troubled ſea, with raging waves, they are<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 20, 21.

And this is the effect of mens looking backward with diſcontent upon things that are paſt; whence it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the onely cure of this diſtemper, is to daſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all ſuch things, to the end that the things preſent, and to come, may be layed to heart in the way of righteouſneſſe: as for thoſe that are truly godly, and walk<note place="margin" type="runSum">Why true Chriſtians look alwayes forward, and not backward. Ph. l. 3. 13, 14.</note> not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, they are inclined of themſelves to forget the things that are behinde; becauſe their whole aime is ſet to preſſe forward towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus: their mark is, to have communion with God in all his wayes, and the excellency of the life of Chriſt, and the joy which is ſet before them doth fill their eye, &amp; drowns all other thoughts, ſo that they look at all times but one onely way, which is heaven-ward: not walking as men, but as citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and worthy of God; they minde the fruits of the ſpirit in all goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe, and truth; they prove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 9, 10.</note> every one in all conditions what is acceptable unto the Lord. And this is that which Miniſters, who deſire to be healers, and to repair theſe breaches, ſhould apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do, and put their hearers in minde of, chiefly at this time when men are ſo much ſet upon miſchief. For what profit can they bring to themſelves, to their hearers, or to the Goſpel of Chriſt, by entertaining them with the grievances of matters that are paſt and gone? there can be none other uſe of this courſe, but to boil up their ſpirits into a paroxiſme of unrulines, and of diſcontentedneſſe againſt thoſe that are in power, to make them unweildie for action, in order to preſent and future occaſions; and to give the common Enemie his hearts deſire againſt us: and how ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this is unto the way of the Goſpel, of righteouſneſſe, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:163962:62"/> of peace, and to the employment of the Meſſengers of Gods love; whoſe aime ſhould be to become helpers of the joy of the faithful, I ſhall leave unto their own conſcience to judge.</p>

                              <note place="margin" type="runSum"> And when they look backward, what they aim at in ſo doing.</note>As for mine own part, I ſhall never call to minde the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes of either partie to reproach them therewith, or to anger any thereby; but when I ſhall be obliged to reflect upon the ſame, I ſhall endevour two things: firſt, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the guilt under which we all lye before God, that we may for our ſelves, and one for another, be humbled under his mighty hand unto repentance? Secondly, to ſet the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are upright in their way, a work, to attend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partialitie, through the love of God and of goodneſſe, all the deſignes of a publick nature which are neceſſarie and commendable, to heal breaches, and to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. And becauſe it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that this ought to be the behaviour of all thoſe who fear God, when he doth viſit a people with his judgements, as is manifeſt by the counſell of <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. I am amazed, and much troubled at the different behaviour of ſome who pretend to zeal in this time of our viſitation, wondering that Satan ſhould be able to prevail ſo farre with them, as to take them off from this<note place="margin" type="runSum"> The obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this courſe at this time reproved.</note> aime, and to make them inſtrumentall to pull back others, and to ſtagger any that is conſcientious, from the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe duties. And that which I moſt wonder at, is the deceitfulneſſe of the perſwaſion, which is uſed, to foment the diviſion of our ſpirits, even in thoſe matters, wherein we are all equally related unto God, for our ſelves and the publick, as in matters of prayer, and of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; ſhall the diſcontents about earthly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reach even unto heaven? ſhall a dutie which is not onely lawfull and commendable in it ſelf as to men, but neceſſarie, and commanded to be obſerved in ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences as we are fallen into, as to God, be not onely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but oppoſed, and made a ſubject of contradiction; nay, and made unlawfull to be obſerved as by us; becauſe of ſome interpretations and conſtructions which we make of the actions of others to their diſadvantage? Should my
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:163962:63"/> ſuppoſall of the failing of another man, who yet is willing to draw nigh unto God with me, and deſirous to have my friendly concurrence and conjunction in drawing neer unto God with him, be a juſt ground for me, to refuſe to pray for publick mercies, and to be thankfull for publick bleſſings? And what although he were as unjuſt in his way, and as guiltie before God, as ſome would make him; is it therefore unwarrantable for me at his deſire (when he is actually in power over me) to worſhip God, by craving and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of ſeaſonable favours, for my ſelf and others? <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was a cruell, unnaturall Tyrant over the Iſraelites, he was a type of a naturall incorrigible man, and declared to be a reprobate, whom God would harden to his deſtruction; yet at his intreatie, <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed not to pray to God for temporall deliverances over him, and his people. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Pharaohs</hi> end in deſiring <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray, was known to be nothing elſe but ſelf-intereſt; yet this took not <hi>Moſes</hi> off from doing the dutie, onely he had a further end then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in it, as ſometimes alſo he declares unto him: which I obſerve to ſhew, that although men be never ſo wicked in their way, and their ends never ſo carnall, in deſiring our prayers for things in themſelves good and lawfull, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is not unlawfull for us, to comply with them in ſuch a dutie. But to refuſe the performance of ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when the publick good, and the edification of all doth require it; onely to ſhew our oppoſition unto thoſe that do deſire it, becauſe of ſome other things wherein we are not ſatisfied with them, is to me a ſubject of great admiration; how it can come into the minds of any pious, conſcionable, knowing and reaſonable men for to ſay, that this conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion unto their deſire will be taken as a complyance with them, in that wherein we diſallow of them; or will tend to confirm them in that which we think to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them, is a great miſtake: firſt in reſpect of the nature<note place="margin" type="runSum">The Anſwer to their Plea for their practiſe.</note> of the duties (which being abſolutely good in their own kinde, and not indifferent, cannot be ſuppoſed to tend unto evill:) ſecondly, in reſpect of the inference which is made upon the performance of theſe duties, which if it be well
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:163962:63"/> lookt into, will be found inconſiſtent with true Pietie, and<note place="margin" type="runSum">Shewing, Firſt, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe thereof.</note> void of Reaſon. For it is neither agreeable to godlineſſe, nor unto reaſon, that I ſhould conclude thus; becauſe it is poſſible that others may, and likely that ſome will, make another conſtruction of that which I am about to do, then I mean they ſhould; that therefore I ſhould be obliged to abſtain from a lawfull and commendable dutie: or thus, becauſe a thing in it ſelf good and laudable, may acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally tend to confirm ſome man in an evill courſe, or in that which we think to be unlawfull in him, that therefore I ſhould be bound not to apply my ſelf unto it, although I am clear, that the thing <hi>per ſe,</hi> and in its own nature, hath no tendency unto the production of ſuch an effect. <hi>Moſes</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, was an accidentall cauſe of his hardning, this <hi>Moſes</hi> knew would be ſo, yet he refuſed not to do the dutie. I ſay therefore that theſe inferences conſiſt neither with the Rules of Pietie, nor of Reaſon; and therefore that the concluſion againſt the condeſcenſion whereof we ſpeak is a great miſtake: it is true, that in things of their own nature indifferent, which by circumſtances are alterable, this conſequence will hold, that if by my complyance with any in that which is free to be done, or left undone, I ſhould think they would be confirmed in that which I diſallow in them, and judge unlawfull for them to do; that then I am bound to abſtain from it, leſt I build them up in that which is evill, and be acceſſorie to their ſin; but in things which in their own nature are holy, juſt and good, it doth not follow, that becauſe others may miſconſtrue, and abuſe what I do, that therefore I ought not to do it; for elſe what ſhall become of the whole profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? for what is in any part of it, or what can any man ſay or do in it, which another that is malicious may not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue, miſapply, and abuſe? this is therefore (as to my apprehenſion) a very unconſcionable and unreaſonable pretence to cover an undutifull practiſe. But I have yet a further obſervation upon this pretence of non concurrence in duties abſolutely good and lawfull, with thoſe that are in power, which is this; that if this practiſe and pretence be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:163962:64"/> lookt into, and layed open in the root whence it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in the end whereunto it doth tend, I ſuppoſe it will<note place="margin" type="runSum">2ly, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof.</note> be found to have much of the Serpent in it, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and unſavourie to a good conſcience: for conſider we whence this ſcruple doth riſe, and is taken up; and to what the practiſe wherunto it leads, doth tend in its own nature, and where it ends.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, the riſe of the ſcruple is this; that ſuch as refuſe to pray, and give thanks ſolemnly for bleſſings upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the deſire of thoſe who are in government, do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look upon matters paſt, as they are inclined to conſider them with diſcontent; and upon things preſent with reference thereunto; conſidering the ſame with a ſullen humour, as in the hands of thoſe that manage the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their ſenſe: wherein they make themſelves abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Judges of all the proceedings paſt, and preſent, of the power and government which is over them; and upon this judgement of the miſcarriages which they lay unto their charge, they frame a reſolution of non-complyance in all things, though in themſelves, never ſo good and profitable to the publick: which how far it is lawfull for them in the way of Chriſtianity to do, we are now about to conſider.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the ſcruple being thus taken up, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto their practiſe doth lead, is to uphold the breach, which they ſuppoſe is alreadie made of the publick peace; which is very unchriſtian: and that wherein it doth end directly, is an oppoſition to the preſent power: ſo that in effect this practiſe doth ſpeak thus much; that the Miniſters of Chriſt may lead men to maintain an oppoſition againſt thoſe that manage publick affairs in every thing; becauſe in one thing concerning the alteration of Government (about the cauſe and way thereof) they are not agreed with them. Now if we cannot ſay, that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are proper Judges of State Intereſts, nor that their miniſteriall work ought to be made oppoſite or ſubordinate thereunto, to lead Chriſtians for or againſt it; then I cannot ſee how it can ſtand with a good conſcience in them, to intend ſuch a practiſe: and as for Chriſtians to follow them in ſuch a practiſe, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:163962:64"/> not how it can be either lawfull or commendable; except they will ſhew, that an obligation is laied upon them by God, as private men, to ſay in their hearts thus: becauſe the proceedings of thoſe men that manage the publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, do croſſe my thoughts, engagements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes concerning the outward ſettlement and government of this world; therefore I ought to be croſſe unto them in all things whatſoever; and to oppoſe them in ſpirituall, as well as in temporall matters: yea, and although theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in themſelves be exceeding lawfull, good, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, yet in their hands I muſt oppoſe them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I can probably foreſee, that by this kinde of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I ſhall hazard to embroil all, and perhaps help to bring my ſelf, and the whole State to ruine and confuſion, yet ſtill I muſt oppoſe them. Now what conſcience can be found in ſuch a reſolution, I ſhall leave to all thoſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that have the Spirit of Chriſt, but that morally are rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, to judge: and yet in effect this is the ſpeech, and plain Engliſh of this pretended ſcruple and practiſe, ſo far as I can make ſenſe of it; wherein I ſhall deſire that three things may be yet further noted.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, what the pernicious effect is, of looking back with carnall diſcontentedneſſe upon the offences which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are given by others; rather then of looking forward with uprightneſſe and ſimplicitie upon the good which we ought to do our ſelves: here we may ſee, how farre this is able to pervert our way from the truth of Chriſtianity, for in true Chriſtianity we are taught; <hi>not to be overcome with evill, but to overcome evil with good.</hi> Rom. 12. ver. 21. But ſuch back-looking ſuggeſtions as theſe, lead us to the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of a quite contrary nature; which make us a verſe unto that which is good, and forwardly yeelding to that which is evil: and from what ſpirit this doth proceed it is eaſie to judge.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, herein we may ſee, how deeply and deceitfully the corruption of humane paſſions can inſinuate it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehenſions of Religiouſneſſe into our conſcience, before we we are aware thereof: which doth undiſcernably
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:163962:65"/> fall out, when we ſuffer our humane affaires and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to mixe themſelves with ſpirituall concernments in our thoughts, and the latter of theſe to be acted by the ſenſe which we have of the former, whereas we ought to have no thoughts of the former, but ſuch as are ſubordinate and commenſurable unto the latter.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, we may ſee alſo herein what the danger is of letting our ſpirits looſe unto ſtrife: for if we once come to be engaged as men, with a deſigne rather to oppoſe other mens perſons hatefully; then as Chriſtians lovingly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to rectifie that which is amiſſe in them, and in their wayes: we can hardly ever ſuffer our ſelves to be diſinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged again; becauſe we know not where to ſtop our courſe of oppoſition, in reſpect of new provocations dayly offered by others. Nor are we naturally inclined to get hold of the reins of our own paſſions to recover our way to a peaceable diſpoſition towards them. I remember that I have read the Acts of one of the generall Synods of the Churches of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Synod. Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von. Actu ſexto.</note> wherein the ſpirit of oppoſition againſt the Anabaptiſts, and Arrians, did ſo farre tranſport thoſe otherwiſe godly men; that they did make a Decree, not to obſerve the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of fitting (which undoubtedly is moſt agreeable to the inſtitution of Chriſt) in the Lords Supper, (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they acknowledge in the ſame Act, that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould be ſet free,) onely becauſe thoſe their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did make uſe of that cuſtom, as if the way of Chriſts Inſtitution of that Ordinance might be laid aſide, rather then that we ſhould ſeem to agree therein with Hereticks. So that the hatred of theſe adverſaries and the deſire to be found oppoſite unto them; did blot out of their mindes, in that matter, the love of Chriſt Jeſus, and the righteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be united unto him in all his imitable wayes. I hope that the ſpirits of theſe Brethren are not yet ſo farre tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but that upon the diſcoverie of this ſnare of Satan, they will quickly recover themſelves out of it: therefore to cure this diſtemper and miſtake of the way, in ſuch as are not incurable, and deſire not to erre obſtinately; I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, in reference to the caſe in hand to ask of their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:163962:65"/> own conſcience theſe two queſtions.</p>
                           <p>Whether at any time, and in any caſe whatſoever, it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a Chriſtian to oppoſe that which is truly good in any, or to doe evill that good may come of it?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, whether Jeſus Chriſt, who did declare in the dayes of his fleſh, that his Kingdome was not of this world, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who in the courſe of his Miniſtery did profeſſe, that <hi>he became all things unto all men</hi> in that which was lawful. If theſe were now amongſt us at this time, would upon matters of earthly circumſtances, and outward changes of humane concernments in State-affaires, proceed thus in the worke of their Miniſtery, and ſuffer their conſciences about the duties thereof, to be intangled into ſuch wordly conſiderations?</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> 
                              <hi>might by all meanes ſave ſome:</hi> And ſhall we ſay in our hearts the contrary thus; I ſhall be made nothing to theſe men, that by all meanes I may help to deſtroy them? God forbid. Such a perſwaſion cannot come from him who hath called us. The Apoſtle ſaith again concerning his Miniſtery, <hi>Though we walke in the fleſh, yet we doe not war after the fleſh.</hi> And ſhall we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of walking after the Spirit in our Miniſteriall employment, make the chiefe ground of our proceedings therein towards the publick, a State-jealouſie, and accordingly wage warre in ſpirituall matters after the manner of men in the fleſh? Shall we that are ſent to teach all men godly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, meekneſſe, harmleſneſſe, and how to deny this world and the wiſdome thereof; become the chiefe leaders of the men of the world to mutuall provocations and irritations, and encourage them to manage oppoſite intereſts about State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters, with the breach of Chriſtian unity? Is it lawfull for us to intend the diſpleaſing of one party to pleaſe another, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to intend the reconciling of them to each other in the love of Chriſt? May we make the vindication of wrongs ſuppoſed to be done by one party againſt another in outward matters, the proper work of our employment? It might be tollerable in <hi>Samſon</hi> (a man raiſed extraordinarily to picke quarrels with the inveterate enemies of the Church of God) being provoked by ſome of them with injuries to ſay, <hi>Now I</hi>

                              <hi>ſhall be more blameleſſe than the Philiſtines though I doe them a diſpleaſure:</hi> But in us to take up a reſolution to diſpleaſe any man, is wholly againſt this Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Doe good to them that hate you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 44.</note> practice, <hi>We give no offence in any thing that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery be not blamed, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 3. As for <hi>Samſon,</hi> he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt himſelfe from blame; all tbat he pretends for his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, was, that his enemies deſerved more blame than he: for he ſought as an enemy, ſome advantage againſt them to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; and ſeeing they had done him wrong firſt, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither to beare it, nor to be behinde-hand with them in matters of diſpleaſure. But that the ordinary meſſengers of Gods love towards all men, and the Diſciples of the Croſſe of Chriſt, ſhould upon any provocation whatſoever, be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take up ſuch a reſolution, is as farre below the dictates of a good conſcience in following Chriſts example, as <hi>Samſons</hi> calling to be a Judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was of a different nature from the courſe wherein God hath ſet us, which is to be dead with Chriſt unto the world, to crucifie the fleſh with the affectios &amp; luſts, &amp; to give up to him that judgeth righteouſly, the righting of all wrongs that are done unto us. I ſhal conclude therefore that the bottome of the demurrer his ſcruple is beaten out (as to ſpirituall actings in Chriſtian duties under the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) if it be found manifeſtly Gods wil that to heal brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of love amongſt brethren, and to prevent the increaſe of publick calamities and confuſions in a Common-wealth, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to look forward how in their callings they ſhould by themſelves readily performe good duties towards all; and not to look backward to demur upon their duties, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend evill to any, by reaſon of other mens offences, or their own privat diſaffections in them.</p>
                           <p>Hitherto we have lookt upon the firſt Rule of this Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhewing the main preparative duty which will fit us to ſeek a Remedy for publick evils, and without which it can not, (though found out) be applyed thereunto to work a cure; we have alſo endeavoured to apply this Rule unto one of the greateſt of our preſent diſtempers: we may now come to the particulars offered in the Apoſtles words; which if men, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:163962:66"/> call themſelves Profeſſors of the name of Chriſt, could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in godly ſimplicity without reſpect unto by-matters, through love to that which is good in Chriſtianity for it ſelfe; we might hope that the cure of our diſeaſes would ſoone be accompliſhed by Gods aſſiſtance.</p>

                           <p>Let us therefore, if we are reſolved to look forward, and not backward any more, proceed towards a full cure of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, after this method which the Holy Ghoſt hath pointed out.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, let us ſet upon the duties which are Poſitive, and then upon the Negative; that is, let us begin our work with the performance of that which is actually good in our own way of walking, before we reflect upon the evils which may befall unto us from others to prevent the ſame. This Rule lies in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the things which are here preſcribed; and it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, in the method of our cure; becauſe we are naturally inclined to a contrary and prepoſterous courſe, which makes us miſcarry in moſt of our undertakings; for our natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy doth lead us, rather to look upon others, then upon our ſelves, and to obſerve rather that which is evil in them to their diſcredit; than that which is good to their encouragement and credit, and to be more apprehenſive of danger from without and conſtrain to prevent the ſame; than ſolicitors of ſafety from within, and careful to ſettle the ſame; all which is contrary to the Rules of true wiſdom and prudency, and doth oblige mens thoughts to dwell without themſelves upon the objects of evils and diſcontentments, whereby they are engaged into crooked courſes, rather to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the work of deſtruction than of edification; but true ſpiritual policy doth ſet our thoughts in another frame, and our courſe in another method.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, it ſets before us the reality of that which is good and lovely, as the end of our undertaking; then it preſents unto us the effectual meanes of attaining, and way of proſecuting the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, by and for our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, by and towards others alſo.</p>
                           <pb n="132" facs="tcp:163962:67"/>
                           <p>And laſtly, it reflects upon the evils and impediments which may be incident to the proſecution of the whole deſigne, to prevent and remove the ſame; and according to this method, the ſpirit of God hath ordered the particular duties recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us in this place, for the poſitive duties, directing us to intend that which in it ſelf is good, are injoyned in the firſt place in <hi>v.</hi> 12. 13, 14. and afterward the negative duties, ſhewing the evils that are to be prevented, are recommended in the ſecond place, in <hi>v.</hi> 15. 16. and of the good things to be intended; that which concernes the ordering of our ſelves to our own works, is put before that which concernes our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards others; for that muſt needes be a ground unto this, and ſo likewiſe of the evils to be prevented, that which is the moſt dangerous, as being a cauſe and ground upon which other evils will follow, is to be prevented or remedied before tbe other be medled withall: namely, that which occaſions our falling away from grace, ought firſt to be lookt into and remedied, before we take in hand to digg up the roots of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to repreſſe the defilements and the profanation of the profeſſion.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee the way of the Cure, which Miniſters ſhould follow in their own Calling, and which they ſhould by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and perſwaſion, lead others unto, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places: theſe then are the particular duties which make up the Remedy of our complicated diſeaſe; and this is the Order to be obſerved in making uſe of the ſame: for in this method the Text doth recommend them to us.</p>
                           <p>The particular duty then to be intended.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, for the ordering of our ſelves towards our own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, is <hi>v. 12. Lift up the hands which hang down, and the knees that are looſened,</hi> and for the ordering of the works of our imployment towards our own undertaking, as <hi>v. 13. And make ſtraight pathes for your feet.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then having rightly ordered our ſelves and our affairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our own Sphere, our next care is, to order our relations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others; where our firſt dutie is to reflect upon the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:163962:67"/> weakneſſe and infirmities which are between them and us, that they may be healed, and not made worſe. And this is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us in the latter part of <hi>verſe 3. Leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</hi> The ſecond duty is to reflect upon the perfections which are to be upheld amongſt us, both in reference to one another, and all of us in reference to God. In reference to one another, we are commanded to maintain peace: And in reference to God, we are commanded to maintain holineſſe, in <hi>verſe 3. Follow peace with all men, and holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Where, before we come to the negative duties, we may obſerve briefly, that the righteous ordering of our owne wayes, is that which doth inable us through love to heale and rectifie the wayes of others; and that thereupon the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to maintain peace and holineſſe with all men, will prove ſucceſsfull, but not otherwiſe. For as there can be no healing of infirmities wrought by us towards others, except our owne wayes being rightly ordered, we be carried forth in love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; ſo there can be no maintaining of peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe with any, except the healing of mutuall infirmities be firſt lovingly and righteouſly intended. So that we ſee in what order the complicated endeavours of Righteouſneſſe, of Love, of Peace, and of Holineſſe, are to be applied, as a remedy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publick diſeaſes and afflictions when Gods chaſtiſement is upon us.</p>
                           <p>When we have ſet the poſitive remedies a-work, we ought then alſo to be cautious leſt the effect of all our endeavours be made void by reaſon of dangerous evils which may be incident to our ſtate, if we take not heed thereunto. The moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all evils is to faile of the grace of God, either by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the Truth, or by loſing the ſenſe thereof: for if this be loſt, or that be caſt off, nothing that is good can be found in us, or remain with us. Therefore this is the firſt evill which is to be prevented, which we are directed to <hi>v. 15. Looking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently leſt any man faile of the grace of God.</hi> Then the ſecond is a conſequence of this defection, and therefore to be lookt unto in the ſecond place, that it may be obſerved and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:163962:68"/> namely, the fructifying of our naturall corruption within our ſelves, or others; and the uncleanneſſe which doth ſpread it ſelfe abroad from thence; whereof we are warned in the latter part of <hi>verſe 15. Leſt any root of bitterneſſe ſpringing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.</hi> As the former evill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates us from the life of God, and the enjoyment of the meanes of ſalvation: ſo this doth bring us under the power of Satan, and the guilt of condemnation. That doth relate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the truth of faith; this to the power of godlineſſe, leſt both firſt that, and then this, be loſt amongſt us: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the third evill which may in the laſt place follow, is alſo to be prevented, which is, an open denying of the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, through love to the World: of which we are taught to beware, <hi>v. 16. Leſt there be any fornicator, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, as Eſau, who for a morſell of meat ſold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus we have a briefe, yet a very ſubſtantiall and full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, (both in reſpect of matter and order) for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all Chriſtian, but chiefly Miniſteriall proceedings in the cure of theſe our evils. If now I ſhould give way to my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to enter upon the diſtinct conſideration of every one of the ingredients of this compound ſpirituall Antidote, to ſhew what influence it hath to cure our diſtempers, and how ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is to our preſent occaſions, I might be very large, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily engaged to ſhew, that in the parts thereof (if taken ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) we have as it were a diſpenſatory of Receipts fit for all the Symptomes of our diſeaſes; and that in the whole (if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the compoſition) we have a moſt provident courſe of Phyſick, or medicinall method preſcribed for the regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of the cure: but I ſhall contract my thoughts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve onely that which is mainly conſiderable, and may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every ones capacity.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:163962:68"/> of the aſtoniſhment of our thoughts, and the dulneſſe and flatneſſe of our courage doth deprive us of reſolution what to doe for our ſelves; by which meanes our hands (the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of action) hang down in a lazy poſture; and our knees (the ſupporters of the whole body for motion) are looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it were out of joynt, and without ſtrength. The hands and knees in the ſpirituall man, are the moving and acting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule, which are the imaginative apprehending objects, and the will and affections moving thereon: theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties hang down, and are looſned from action, when we are out of heart with buſineſſes, and diſcouraged to undertake the works of our employment. This indiſpoſition is very frequent in theſe our times, upon all the unexpected changes and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of affaires, wherein of a ſudden men know not where to find themſelves, as being at a loſſe; and the worſt is, that they who <hi>ſhould by inſtructing many, ſtrengthen the weak hands, and</hi>

But againſt this faint-heartedneſſe, and the grievous thoughts which ſome ſuggeſt unto drooping ſpirits, the Apoſtolicall exhortation is in this place a Cordiall, preſcribing unto them a draught of reſolution from above, which will inable them, if they receive it, to lift up their heads, their hands, and their knees, to the duties of their calling, upon the conſideration of the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects of their chaſtiſements, which is the <hi>peaceable fruit of righteonſneſſe,</hi> which it <hi>will yeeld unto them that are exerciſed thereby: Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lift up your hands, &amp;c.</hi> and be of good cheere and reſolute, becauſe the end of your triall is for peace and righteouſneſſe, onely be not wanting to your ſelves, fall to the workes of your employment, and raiſe your affections to be active therein: for in ſo doing your duty there is hope; your <hi>confidence</hi> and courage in well-doing, <hi>is not to be caſt away, becauſe it hath a great recompence of reward, Heb.</hi> 10. 35.

There be ſome that make it their work to make the times worſe then indeed they are, by prepoſſeſſing the ſpirits of the multitude againſt the conſtitution of the State, and the wayes of their Rulers: Theſe men by their ſuggeſtions, diſcourage the plain-hearted from the reſolutions of walking chearfully in their wayes, as bcometh Chriſtians, and ſet them out of their Sphere, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcontent and fearfulneſſe. Let ſuch then, who make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtrumentall to ſtagger the hearts, and weaken the hands of their Brethren, by diſquieting their affections upon doubtfull conſiderations of things which are extrinſecall to the ſtations of private men, and whereof they are no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges; look well to it, that the evill which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to procure unto the times, overtake them not: For in the ſame place where the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in evill times is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to comfort the righteous with promiſe, he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a heavy threatning to the wicked, which is due to the practiſe of theſe men. <hi>Wo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto the wicked, it ſhall be</hi>

                              <p>This reſolution thus taken, will fit our mind for our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and then the duty next to be laid to heart, will fit the workes which we are to take in hand for our places and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereof the Rule is this, That we ſhould <hi>make ſtraight paths for our feet.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The feet of the ſoule are all the moving faculties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which carry it from one object to another, as the feet of the body carry it from one place to another. The paths of theſe feet are both the objects wherewith our ſoule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, and the ſteps of our proceeding in moving about the ſame. The objects are all the affaires of a Religious, Naturall and Civill property, according to the ſeverall relations in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate &amp; publick wherein we are ſet. The ſteps are the thoughts, the affections, and the outward actions by which we are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one object to another. The ſtraightneſſe of theſe paths, is, the enemies both of the way wherin we walke, and of our motion therein: the enemies of the way is the lawfulneſs of the things themſelves, when the objects of our employment are none other but ſuch as they ought to be in our proper ſtations, when they are made free from crooked turnings and windings, and laid in a direct line before us from their beginnings to their endings; and when the rugged and unequall paths thereof are made ſmooth and plain, that is, the knotty circumſtances of affaires taken off by equity. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our motion in this way, is the lawfulneſs of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and carriage, in following a direct courſe, neither tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the right nor left hand till our journies end, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unequally, one time too high, another time too low, as thoſe that halt.</p>
                              <p>And to make theſe pathes ſtraight, our care muſt be of two things; firſt to reflect upon the end of our work, and then upon the meanes by which it is attainable; for there be two parts of folly in our nature, which pervert all our wayes: the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:163962:70"/> one is Childiſhnes, when we conſider not to what purpoſe we are buſie; the other is improdence, when we conſider not our work is to be carried on. To avoid the firſt of theſe, we muſt not ſuffer the faculties of our ſoule to walk at random about their objects; but ſhould determine the purpoſe of their motions by a known and undoubted Rule towards that which is manifeſtly good, and to avoid the ſecond branch of folly, we muſt ſet our faculties and their motions a work, in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way without confuſion, and diſproportion, according to their places and properties in nature.</p>
                              <p>Thus then, he that will fit his work in Righteouſneſs to his proper place and abilities, that it may not miſcarry, muſt forecaſt and conſider his whole way with every thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it, and his own walking therein; this forecaſt muſt contain two parts: the one poſitive, the other negative.</p>
                              <p>The poſitive forecaſt is that which hitherto we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning the end of our undertakings, and the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the meanes and motions tending thereunto, by a ſure and known Rule, without which we have no light in us, and can do nothing but play the foole in every thing.</p>
                              <p>Therefore ſuch as walk not by a known Rule, and love not to come to the light thereof, to approve unto all men, but chiefly to thoſe with whom they have to do their aimes, and the meanes and wayes of their proceeding to gaine the ſame; but cover their Councel deepe, and hide theſe things from thoſe that are concerned therein; make no ſtrait pathes for their feet, and do not the truth, and by this they are known that their works are not done in God; whereas others who forecaſt without prejudice and partiality their affaires, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further therein, then they have a rule to warrant them, love to diſcover themſelves, as in the preſence of God before every one.</p>
                              <p>The Negative forecaſt is that which doth conſider the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, incident to the work of our employment, how they may be removed; for ſeeing the whole world doth lie in wickednes, and we cannot avoid meeting with the croſſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of wickednes either in the crookednes of our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in others, we cannot be ſaid to have made ſtraight
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:163962:70"/> pathes for our feet, except ſome preparations be made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and obviat the ſame.</p>
                              <p>The impediments then which ſhould be foreſeen, lie either in the objects of our work, or in the working faculties: the objects are either things or perſons. The impediments to be foreſeen in things, are the evil qualities thereof, which by reaſon of the curſe and bondage of corruption cleave to the whole Creation: therefore to make our pathes ſtraight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of things, we ought to diſcerne their defects, as well as their uſeful properties; we ought to preſuppoſe and ſuſpect more defects in them than we are able to diſcerne, and we ought not to venture upon their abilities further, than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſefulnes of their natural activity, is plainly diſcovered unto us.</p>
                              <p>The impediments to be foreſeen, in perſons, (for no man can do any thing in this world without ſome relation towards other men) ought to be conſidered as well with reference to thoſe who are directly or collaterally concerned in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we take in hand; as with reference to thoſe who are not concerned therein, but yet are likely to take notice thereof: as for thoſe with whom we have to do; our conſiderations ſhould run chiefly upon the impediments which may fall in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the circumſtances of our ſtation and relation towards them, and about the apprehenſions and thoughts which they may have of our perſons and proceedings: in all which we ſhould reflect upon the occaſion of offence, which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, either as given by us for want of circumſpection, or as taken by them, for want of ſufficient information: Therefore to make our paths ſtraight in reſpect of perſons, the way is to deale ſo in love, in ſimplicity, and in warines of prudency with them, as to prevent miſtakes, and not to venture upon any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize towards any, before ſtumbling blocks be removed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, according to the Apoſtles rule, <hi>give none offence, neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 32.</p>
                              <p>Laſtly, the impediments to be foreſeen in our own working faculties, are the ſinful inclinations of our wills, the diſorderli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our underſtandings, beſides the darkneſs thereof, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:163962:71"/> the unrulines of our luſts and paſſions; together, with the weaknes of our beſt abilities, as they are in our own hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to every thing we apply them unto.</p>
                              <p>Therefore to make our pathes ſtraight, in reſpect of our own working faculties; we ought not only, to look often conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably upon our infirmities, to keep a ſtrict guard over them, and by the ſpirit of Prayer and Faith, to ſeeke help and ſupply of grace in time of need againſt them; but we ſhould before all our undertakings, bind over our ſoules to the obſervation of theſe three Rules.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Never to attempt any thing without the Warrant of a clear call from God.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Never to ſet upon any work, though our call be never ſo clear unto it, without a due examination and preparation of our heart about the aime which we ſhould have in it.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Although our aime be never ſo good and commendable, yet not to proceed any further, than with modeſty, we can meaſure out the undertaking as proportionable unto our place and abilities, that we may keep within compaſſe, and not ſuffer our attempts to go beyond our line.</p>
                              <p>Theſe are ſummarily the heads of matters contained in the ſecond duty, which being neglected, make men guilty of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold privat and publick miſcarriages &amp; offences. And would to God the Brethren who have taught others to demurre and make a ſcruple of Conſcience, about concurring with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent power in lawful things, tending to the publick good; had ſeriouſly before they took that work in hand, reflected upon theſe rules, to make ſtraight pathes unto their feet thereby; for that hitherto they have not done this, there is juſt cauſe to complain; but if they yet would begin, before it be too late, to reflect thus upon their wayes, and follow this Councel; perhaps our breach might be healed: it is evident, that we are out of the way of peace, and that we cannot come into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, except we apply our ſelves to the way of Righteouſneſs. I ſuppoſe it is undeniable: if we ſeek this way by theſe Rules, undoubtedly we ſhall find it; the Lord grant us eyes, both to ſee it, and alſo to obſerve our own ſtrayings from it, and as we have diſcovered the way, ſo it would be no difficult matter,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:163962:71"/> (if it could edifie) to ſet the ſtrayings of our Brethren in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before their eyes, and by the topies of this directory, as by a line and plummet to ſhew them the unevenneſs of their pathes in this matter; but I ſhall ſpare my ſelf this labour, wiſhing rather that they may do it themſelves; <hi>for Chriſt doth</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note>
                                 <hi>not rejoyce in iniquity but in the truth,</hi> &amp; my deſire is, in covering their weakneſs, <hi>to heale that which is lame, that it may not</hi> any more <hi>be turned out of the way.</hi> For this is the third Apoſtolical Rule, by which the cures of theſe and other miſcarriages, in privat and publick, are to be endeavoured. Let us then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apoſtles meaning in it.</p>
                           </div>
                           <div type="duty">
                              <head>The duty of healing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</head>
                              <p>By lameneſs I underſtand here all manner of infirmities, which take not away the motions of the faculties; but onely make them in their proceedings irregular; for properly to be lame, is to have a weakneſs in the moving faculty, cauſing an unequal motion, which is unſeemly and diſproportionat to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens faculties and motions, in reſpect of ſtrength and ſwiftnes; whence alſo this inconvenience doth follow the lameneſs of a Member, that it may ſoone be turned out of the way, either by its own unequal mocions, if the way wherein it walketh be rugged and narrow: or by the uncharitableneſs of others, who being ſtronger, may juſtle it out of the way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be neither rugged nor narrow. Now that there are amongſt us many lameneſſes, and that the lame are turned out of the way, as well by their own weak, innocent, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motions, as by the evil will of others, who juſtle with them, cannot be denied. Therefore this duty of healing, and of keeping the lame in the way which is the effect of love and righteouſneſs, muſt be applyed unto this ſymptome of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Here the work of love (as every where elſe) muſt have the firſt place, and the influence which it hath towards the weak, is by way of compaſſion, whereof the effect is a deſire and endeavour to eaſe them of the evil wherewith they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: the work of Righteouſneſs hath the ſecond place, whereof the influence is by way of innocency, and the effect is to be no way acceſſory to the Cauſes of begetting or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing any lameneſs among us, or of diſturbing any good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne by turning the lame out of the way; and thus by this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:163962:72"/> third Rule, when we have made our own work ſtraight for our ſelves, our ſteps towards others are to be regulated, that we may alſo walk ſtraightly therein towards all men, being uſefull towards them and harmleſſe; where the uſefullneſſe of our waſhing is to be made ſtraight, by the Law of Love which doth cover and heale that which is amiſſe, and the harmleſnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be made ſtraight by the Law of indempnity, that if we cannot make their condition better, to be ſure not to wrong them by making it worſe.</p>
                              <p>If the Brethren, who in oppoſition to the preſent power, refuſe to act with others in good and lawfull things, that which in it ſelf is acceptable to God and approved of men: had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered our preſent publick ſtate with compaſſion; and had laid to heart this rule, to walk dutifully thereby as Chriſtians ought, they could not have engaged themſelves in a courſe ſo contrary to that Charity which cals upon conſcionable men to the healing of publick calamities; and to that righteouſneſſe; which ſhould keep Chriſtians from turning weak conſciences out of the way. For if they whom God hath ſet in the place of ſubjection throughout this Nation, ſhould be provoked to a willfull halting, and to go forward (as many do) but lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ſubmiſſion to the power that is over them, till they turn themſelves quite out of the way of all orderlineſſe, by a refractory ſcrupuloſity, and then be juſtly turned out of the way of Peace and ſafety: either by the totall diſſolution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or by the breaking in of power upon them for their unjuſt behaviour, to whom ſhould all ſuch evills be imputed? Muſt they not fall to the account of thoſe that do provoke them to the cauſes thereof, and have no thought of mutuall compaſſion and tenderneſſe to heale one anothers infirmities? Muſt they not be laid to the charge of thoſe, who rather than not to oppoſe the powers that are over them, will renounce the practiſe of the beſt and moſt ſolemn duties of Chriſtianity, onely to ſhew their diſaffecrion unto them? Surely it cannot be expected, that the obſtinate oppoſition to all orderly courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (whereupon all common ſafety is grounded) can be of long continuance without ſome great Judgement; nor that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme powers of any State in the world, will ſuffer themſelves
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:163962:72"/> alwaies to be openly deſpiſed, (though they may bear it for a while) and oppoſed in things undeniable, juſt and equitable, by thoſe that are wholly under their power. We may ſee therefore that in end this can produce nothing but the fruits of bitterneſſe and grief: and where no healing of grievances is at all aimed at; but a direct turning of the lame in all things, out of the way; there all manner of confuſion, with irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable war, and hatred muſt needs break forth in the minds of a people.</p>

                              <p>Therefore to take away theſe evils, which unavoidably will follow the neglect of this third Duty, the Apoſtle doth adde further two duties, which are joint in the Cure; but in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication diſtinctly make up, the fourth and fifth part of the Remedy of theſe publick evils. The fourth Duty is, to <hi>follow Peace with all men.</hi> And the fifth is, <hi>to follow</hi> (in like manner with all men) <hi>Holineſſe without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Let us briefly ſee what theſe things mean.</p>
                              <p>To follow Peace, is to mind, intend, and do all things: which may procure and keep between our ſelves and others: mutuall quietneſſe from hurtfull thoughts and attempts, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian good will of being helpefull to each other againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> miſeries, may not be utterly loſt and obſtructed amongſt us. Now this is an endeavour which Chriſtians are bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably to maintain towards all men, if it be poſſible ſo farre as in them lieth; even as Chriſt Jeſus the Prince of Peace did maintaine it towards ſinners, in the midſt of their greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 19. 20.</note> and contradiction againſt himſelf: For in that it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he did not ſtrive, nor cry, nor cauſed any man to heare his voice in the ſtreets:</hi> his quietneſſe is commended; and when it is ſaid, <hi>that the bruiſed reed he did not breake, nor did he quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> his harmleſneſſe is ſet forth; and when it is added, that by this meanes, <hi>He ſhould bring forth judgement unto victory, and that the Gentiles ſhould truſt in his Name.</hi> His helpfulneſſe unto all mankind againſt their common miſeries is declared, as the true end, and proper effect of that peaceable behaviour. This then is the example by which all men, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould walk before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers towards every one. And if the thoughts of Peace ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:163962:73"/> be thus extended unto all, and chiefly by Miniſters; How will it be warrantable for any, or in any reſpect for theſe to exclude the powers under which we are ſet from the ſame? and that by an aime to ſtrive againſt them in all things; though they be things in themſelves and for the publick never ſo good and uſefull? Chriſtianity doth ſet a rule to the ſpirits of men: Now if the frame of mens ſpirits be wholly bent to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and oppoſe ſome nen in particular continually; How will they clear themſelves before God; whoſe command is, that they ſhould follow Peace with all men ingenerall; and that if it be poſſible, &amp; as much as in them lieth, that is, at all times, and upon occaſions whenſoever they have to do with them?</p>
                              <p>And becauſe whereſoever the thoughts of Peace and good<note place="margin">James 3. 19.</note> will prevaile not, but envying and ſtrife rather take place; there is <hi>alwaies confuſion, and every evill work,</hi> which defile the hearts and hands of men before God.</p>

It is then the Spirit of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification which cleanſeth this corruption at the root; whence it appears, that the Reaſon why men do not ſeek Peace, and follow after it with all men, is, becauſe they want Holineſſe, and ſeek not after it; that is, they ſet not their hearts aright, to <hi>take hold of Grace, whereby they may ſerve God acceptably with</hi>

                                 <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note>

For the naturall property of Holineſſe, as it is originally in God, and from him derived unto us, doth put an extreme diſtance between the deſires of Saints, and thoſe inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which beget ſtrife in other men. For in God originall Holineſſe is a property of his eternall being, by which we conceive him to be moſt gloriouſly pure in himſelf, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all creatures and imaginable qualities, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unconceiveably beautifull in all perfections; ſo that in him, and in all his wayes, there is, hath been, and ſhall be nothing but pure and perfect goodneſſe for ever and ever, without any ſhadow of turning: This property of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature we are made partaker of by Chriſt, for of his fulneſſe we receive all, and grace for grace; and in him the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15, 16</note> Father doth call upon us <hi>to be holy, as he is holy.</hi> Holineſſe then in us is the conformity of our ſpirit and ſtate unto God in this property of his nature; whereby we become pure and undefiled, ſet a part unto him from all uncleanneſſe; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the cauſes of diſorder and luſtfulneſſe in the creatures, that we may have communion with him: for without this conformity unto him in his nature, there can be no fellowſhip between him and us; for what communion hath purity with uncleanneſſe, or light with darkneſſe? for which cauſe alſo the Apoſtle addes this doctrinall clauſe to his exhortation, that <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God:</hi>
                                 <pb n="146" facs="tcp:163962:74"/> both to ſtir us up the more to follow after it, as that which is ſo abſolutely neceſſarie for our ſalvation; that the want thereof doth inevitably threaten a ſeparation between God and us for ever. And alſo to intimate an implyed promiſe, that if we follow holineſſe with all men, we ſhall be made fit to ſee God, as well in his works here in time towards all men, as in himſelf face to face hereafter for ever.</p>
                              <p>It is evident then by this, that the following of Holines with all men, doth make us peaceable towards all men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it takes us off from the occaſions of carnall ſtrife, and unites us unto God in the puritie of the Divine nature: but where the heart is not cleanſed, and made above all things carefull in ſerving God acceptably, to walk in the ſphere of a pure life, above the defilements of creature concernments, there it cannot attain to a peaceable diſpoſition, neither within it ſelf, nor towards others. And without ſcruple we may conclude thus, that whereſoever men are not raiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that univerſall peaceableneſſe of ſpirit which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, there they come alſo far ſhort of the duty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is here recommended unto them. Let therefore no men deceive themſelves, and lye againſt the Truth: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever do take up a reſolution rather to ſtrive and conteſt with ſome men about the affairs of this world for their own ſake, then to follow Peace and Holineſſe with all men for Gods ſake; are not in a caſe to ſee God, or to ſerve him acceptably in all things, becauſe the paſſion of luſt for themſelves, which is the cauſe of all ſtrife between them and others, is inconſiſtent with that reverence and fear, which is requiſite to ſerve him acceptably.</p>

                              <p>Thus we ſee, what the Poſitive Rules whereby our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and diſtempers may be cured are, and how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend one upon another. Concerning the Negative Duties which follow, I ſhall be very brief, for if theſe former be carefully obſerved, there will be no difficulty in the practiſe of the latter, but with eaſe and ſafetie they will fall in of themſelves. For he that followeth holineſſe with all men, muſt needs follow it by the Truth, which is the ground of that performance. Now the Truth which doth beget Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:163962:74"/> in all thoſe that are ſanctified, is, <hi>the Grace of God which hath appeared, and bringeth ſalvation unto all men; teaching us to deny ungodlineſſe, and worldly luſts; and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in tgis preſent world: looking for the bleſſed hope; and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity; and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The truth of this Doctrine is the Grace which bringeth ſalvation unto all men; and this it doth by teaching them the way to true holineſſe in and by Chriſt Jeſus: he then that doth follow this, (namely, Holineſſe) with all men, muſt needs look after that (namely, Truth) in every one, leſt any fail of it: for if the knowledge of this ſaving Truth ſhould fail, and be caſt off by any, as then he will be taken off from the way of Holineſſe; ſo he will be ſet to follow the imaginations of his own heart, which can ſend forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſeeds of corruption, which will beget roots of bitterneſſe, whereby many will be defiled. The way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the growing up of theſe roots, is to keep the heart poſſeſt with theſe principles of ſaving knowledge, which are the fundamentals of all Goſpel, faith, and hope for Grace: and to do this there is none other direct means, but to hold forth the teſtimony of Jeſus, ſo as to commend the truth thereof to the conſcience of all men in the ſight of God, which is done by manifeſting the light of life which is in Chriſt with <hi>ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned; that he who is of the contrary party, may be aſhamed, having no evill thing to ſay of us,</hi> or of our teſtimony. Whence I ſhall infer this, that the way to maintain Religion by the ſhaken reed of meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, and to beat down the errors of the minde with the club-law of corporall puniſhments (which ſome have endeavoured to do) is no part of Gods counſell: for that which hath upheld, and will uphold the Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without, yea and againſt, all the might of the world, is nothing elſe but the evidence, and the demonſtration of the ſpirit and power, and that which hath beaten down, and will beat down hereſies and errors, is nothing elſe but the armour of Righteouſneſſe on the right hand and on the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:163962:75"/> left, by which all the imaginations of men, and ſtrong holds of Satan in them are caſt down; and every thought is brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod then both to prevent, and to correct errors is this, that we ſhould take care, that the faithful word which hath been taught, and as it hath been taught by the Apoſtles and Prophets be held faſt, and held forth, that by the ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof, we may be inabled both to exhort thoſe that ſtand in the Truth, that they take heed leſt they fall from it; and to convince the gainſayers, whoſe mouthes muſt be ſtopped by religious dealing, and rationall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with them. If then we ſhould apply our ſelves to dig up the roots of bitterneſſe which are ſprung up amongſt us, (for to prevent the riſing of them is too late) we ſee, that the way to be taken is this; that on the one hand Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecall Truths ſhould be fundamentally taught, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the form of ſound words enlarged upon, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and on the other hand, orderly conferences ſhould be ſet afoot, and regulated by Authority, that vain-talkers and deceivers may not be left without conviction: and this the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould intend before all others, as the proper work of their peculiar calling.</p>

                              <p>Thus then by this way of looking out, we may both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and correct, the falling of many from the grace of God; and the growing up of the roots of bitterneſſe which have defiled many: but as concerning the profane, who, like <hi>Eſau</hi> in their uncleannes, are come to that height of impiety, that they renounce openly the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, for a morſell of ſenſuall pleaſure in this preſent world; there can be no dealing with them, as I conceive, but two wayes, if God peradventure will give ſome of them repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life. The one is to deal rationally, the other to deal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively with them. In dealing with them rationally, the principles of Humanity and Morality muſt be brought home unto their conſcience, to diſcover unto them, what the indignitie and vileneſſe is of theſe defilements, wherein they wallow themſelves like unto beaſts; what the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe is of all their preſent enjoyments: what in that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:163962:75"/> courſe their loſſe of Honour and Perfection is by man in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other courſe attainable: and whence all this doth ariſe in them, to the prejudice of their own ſtate of true happineſſe, and of the ſocietie of mankinde: that ſo much reaſon and moralitie as may be found remaining in them, and is not become brutiſh through ſenſuality, may be kept alive, and (if poſſible) wakened unto righteouſneſſe.</p>
                              <p>In dealing with them authoritatively, notice muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their open profeſſion of profaneneſſe, that it may be repreſſed in them, and they brought to ſhame for it, of their plots and practiſes againſt Chriſtianity, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to bring reproach upon the profeſſors thereof; by making them contemptible for the profeſſions ſake: and of their exceſſe of riot and ſenſuality, leſt others be infected, and perverted by their example: for which they ought to be made lyable to ſome puniſhments; that they may ſtand in a we, and fear, if not God, yet vertuous men, and the loſſe of their own bodily conveniencie. Now the puniſhment which I conceive a Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſhould inflict, at leaſt upon thoſe that are found incorrigible, is, that which <hi>Abraham,</hi> at <hi>Sarahs</hi> requeſt, and by Gods approbation of her<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> deſire, did inflict upon <hi>Iſmael,</hi> becauſe he mocked <hi>Iſaac:</hi> which was, that he did caſt him out of his houſe: and the puniſhment which <hi>David,</hi> as a Magiſtrate in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, doth reſolve to execute againſt all wicked doers, in the diſcharge of his dutie towards God, which is, to <hi>cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord:</hi> that is, at leaſt<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> to baniſh them; or diſcountenance them ſo, that they ſhall not finde any abode in the Common-wealth with content.</p>
                              <p>And thus farre we have followed the Apoſtle in the firſt part of this Directorie; let us now come to the ſecond part thereof, and take the royall Prophet for our Director therein.</p>

                        <head>The ſecond part of the Directorie relating to the duty of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in the cure of our diſeaſes.</head>
                        <p>Hitherto then we have ſeen, how all profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but chiefly the Miniſters of the Goſpel, are taught what they ought to do towards the cure of our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, in their charge, by the adminiſtration and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine love unto the ſymptoms thereof: but now
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:163962:76"/> we ſhall alſo, God willing, obſerve briefly, how all that have power and authority over others, but chiefly the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates of Nations knowing God, are taught what they ought to do towards a further cure of the ſame diſeaſes, by the adminiſtration and application of Divine Righteouſneſſe unto the ſymptoms thereof in their peculiar places.</p>
                        <p>I conceive then, that the holy Ghoſt hath ſet forth <hi>David</hi> in the 101. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as a pattern of righteouſneſſe, to teach all Magiſtrates their duty, that they may learn to write after the copy which he hath ſet them. Let us then conſider, and contemplate in him the ſpirit of a true Chriſtian Magiſtrate, by the Analyſis of his words, and ſome ſhort obſervations to be made thereon.</p>
                        <div type="part">
                           <head>The pattern of a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate ſet forth in Pſal. 101. Where of the brief Analyſis is given.</head>
                           <p>The propheticall King intending to make profeſſion of that which in the diſcharge of his Magiſtracie he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to perform; doth in the 1. ver: of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> declare three things by way of Preface. 1. The matter whereof he did purpoſe to ſpeak: <hi>I will ſing of mercy and judgement.</hi> 2. The Perſon to whom he would addreſſe his ſpeech: <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee O Lord will I ſing.</hi> 3. The manner of delivering himſelf: <hi>I will ſing, I will ſing.</hi> Where we ſhall obſerve theſe foure points for an introduction.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What the ſumme and ſubſtance of a Magiſtrates em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is, whereupon all his thoughts ſhould be ſet: that it is <hi>Mercie and Judgement. Mercie</hi> is his work towards the godly and honeſt: Judgement towards the ungodly and diſhoneſt: towards thoſe, Protection and favour is the work of Mercy; towards theſe, to diſcover, and to puniſh them, is the work of Judgement. Whence we may further conclude, that to leave the vertuous without encouragement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; or the wicked without reproof and puniſhment, is not onely want of judgement in a Magiſtrate, but crueltie againſt the State over which he is ſet; how much more then if he ſhould perſecute the godly, and favour the wicked?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That Magiſtrates ought to intend the performance of their duty for conſcience ſake towards God, and not for any other deſigne of their own, as many uſe to do: for <hi>David</hi>
                              <pb n="151" facs="tcp:163962:76"/> here ſets himſelf as in the preſence of God, to ſpeak, and make profeſſion of his duty unto him; <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I ſing. To thee,</hi> as to the great witneſſe of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my heart, in this profeſſion of my duty. And <hi>to thee,</hi> as to my Judge and Soveraigne, to whom I am accountable in all the works of my employment. For Magiſtrates judge not for men, but for the Lord: and happie would they be, if they could be mindfull of this.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That the profeſſions which Magiſtrates make of their duty, and of their reſolutions ought not to be addreſſed as to men; to cajole them with fair words, and gain credit with them: but as to God, in the nature of a religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to bring an obligation voluntarily upon their own ſouls to perform their duty.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That Magiſtrates ſhould undertake the works of their calling with a great deal of cheerfulneſſe; and that to ſuch as are in places of eminent truſt, the diſcharge of their duty ſhould be the chief matter of their joy. For we ſee here with what cheerfulneſſe of minde <hi>David</hi> doth undertake his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; I <hi>will ſing, I will ſing,</hi> ſaith he, twice repeating the expreſſion, once in reſpect of Mercy and Judgement; another time in reſpect of God. For his duty relates to both at once; materially to the one, and finally to the other. A worldly minded man coming to preferment, doth rejoyce that he is exalted above others; and hath gotten power to do his own will: But a godly man doth rejoyce in the aſſurance of Gods favour; <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon us: thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart, more then in the time that their corn and their wine increaſed.</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. 7. And again, <hi>Thy ſtatutes</hi> (ſaith he to God) <hi>are my ſongs in the houſe of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> Pſal. 119. 54.</p>
                           <p>And this much the Preface doth teach and direct Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates concerning their employment; the profeſſion of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> reſolutions follow, wherein he declares, firſt, what he will endevour to do in his place and calling: ſecondly, to what effect, and end he will proſecute that endevour. That which he will endevour, doth concern partly himſelf in his own perſon, partly the perſons of other men.</p>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:163962:77"/>
                           <p>Firſt, he reſolves to order himſelf towards the doing of that which is good; then towards the avoiding of that which is evill. Towards the doing of good, he not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon the duty, but prays unto God for his preſence with him in it. The Duty reſolved upon, is ſet forth in the thing, to be followed, in the manner of following it, and in the means whereby it may be attained. The thing to be followed and aimed at, is a <hi>Perfect way.</hi> The manner of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>2</label> it, is with wiſdom; <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way.</hi> And the means whereby this aime may be attained, is to walk in his particular ſtation, with a frame of heart ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thereunto. His particular ſtation is his houſe; <hi>I will walk within my houſe.</hi> And the frame of heart ſutable to his aime is, <hi>with a perfect heart.</hi> A perfect heart towards God, will bring a man and keep him in his way, which is perfect. In the midſt of this reſolution, between the expreſſion of his aime, and of the means to attain it, a prayer is put up, for the aſſiſtance of Gods preſence with him in the undertaking. <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me:</hi> which doth preſuppoſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe layed hold of, that God would come and be with him: and it doth expreſſe his faith, and expectation of the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that promiſe. A promiſe to this effect is given to all beleevers, in <hi>Iſa. 64. 5. Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſſe.</hi> But more expreſly <hi>David</hi> might look upon the promiſe made to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and in his name to all faithfull Magiſtrates, where God ſaith: <hi>As I was with Moſes ſo I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee: onely be thou ſtrong, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all the Law,</hi> &amp;c. This Commandment he reſolves to do, by walking in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way with a perfect heart; and therefore he expects the fulfilling of the promiſe made to the performance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prays for the ſame. Thus then he ſets himſelf, not in his own ſtrength, but under the conduct of God, for the doing of that which is good: as for the avoiding of that which is evill, he takes up a twofold reſolution: firſt, to free himſelf from evill objects and ends, <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing</hi>
                              <label type="milestone">

                              <hi>before mine eyes:</hi> (the originall is, <hi>no word of Belial:</hi> now Belial
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:163962:77"/> ſignifies one that is, without yoke and diſorderly; So that his meaning is more properly, I will not intend to be without yoke or to do any thing out of order.) Secondly, to free himſelf from the meanes and inſtruments ſubſervient thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which are all the works of men turning away from the will of God. <hi>I hate the work of them that turne aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe are his reſolutions concerning himſelf, the things which he reſolves concerning others, are partly againſt thoſe that are vicious, partly for thoſe that are vertuous:</p>
                           <p>Againſt thoſe that are vicious, his reſolutions ſeeme to run in two Channels; the one under a more private, the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more publick relation; and in each reſpect his reſolutions againſt them have three parts or degrees. The firſt tends to a ſeparation from his acquaintance and familiarity; the ſecond to a baniſhment: and the third to an oppoſition and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of them.</p>
                           <p>In the Channell of private relations, he reſolves thus againſt the vicious,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, to ſeparate two ſorts of vicious men from his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and familiarity, the firſt are thoſe of a froward and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe heart; that is, men whoſe intentions and deſignes are perverted from the right way. <hi>A froward heart ſhall depart</hi>

                           <p>Then to baniſh and cut off from all private ſociety, him that is a backbiter of his neighbour; <hi>who ſo privily ſlandereth his</hi>
                              <label type="milestone">

                           </p>
                           <p>And thirdly, to oppoſe and put down as unſufferable the proud and ambirious, <hi>him that hath a high look and a proud heart,</hi>

                           <p>Having thus determined how to behave himſelf againſt thoſe that are vicious in reſpect of privat relations; he reſolves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame relations for thoſe that are vertuous, that he will ſeeke them out, to bring them near unto himſelf, that they may abide with him. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithfull in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:163962:78"/> the Land, that they may dwell with me.</hi>

                           <p>For we ſee here, that as <hi>David</hi> doth ſet himſelf in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto God, by thinking upon his Charge, with depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, and making his application with chearfulneſſe therein unto him: ſo the end of all his endeavours is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Peace and ſafety of the City of the Lord, which is his Church, that wicked doers may be ſeparated from it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, From the particulars and their coherence, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Concluſions.</p>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:163962:78"/>
                           <p>1. That Magiſtrates ſhould wiſely order themſelves before they thinke of ordering other men: they muſt firſt looke to themſelves, and then to others.</p>
                           <p>For we ſee here, that <hi>David</hi> makes this the firſt part of his care; and what the Apoſtle ſaith of the fitneſſe of an Elder to Rule in the Church, muſt be ſaid of a Magiſtrate to Rule in the Common-wealth: <hi>If a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> So we<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> may ſay, if a man hath no care, and zeal to order his own way aright; how ſhall he take care, and be zealous to order the waies of other men to a publick good.</p>
                           <p>2. That all men but chiefly Magiſtrates, in looking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould ſettle before all other things clearly, the Relation which is betweene God and themſelves in their places.</p>
                           <p>For we ſee that <hi>David</hi> makes this the ground-work of all his other Reſolutions and Profeſſions: and the Reaſon of it is clear, not onely becauſe Magiſtrates, who repreſent God on earth, can have no aſſurance of ſucceſſe, or ability to ſtand in their places, further than their relation unto God is clear and intire; but in generall there is a curſe denounced againſt all men, <hi>Whoſe heart departeth from the Lord, they ſhall be like the heath in the deſart, and not ſee when good commeth. Jer.</hi> 17. 5. 6. If a Subject on earth take upon him to Govern his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without a Commiſſion from his Soveraigne, he is an uſurper: ſo is every Magiſtrate before God, though his right be good as to men; yet his ſpirit is an Uſurper of his place, if by ſettling his relation towards God, in his place; he receive not his Commiſſion from him.</p>
                           <p>3. That no Magiſtrate can have any ſettlement of his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards God, or pretend to any Commiſſion from God in his place: except his ſpirit be ordered towards him in theſe three things.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Except he know the way of Perfection, wherein God doth appoint him to walk. For this is the chief point of his Commiſſion, or rather the whole ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Except he intend, and reſolve to follow that way, behaving himſelf therein wiſely and conſiderately, to fit
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:163962:79"/> all occaſions thereunto; and with a ſincere and upright heart, to approve himſelf to God therein; For if he doth not this, he hath not accepted of his Commiſſion (although he may know fully the contents thereof) and conſequently hath no right to his place.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Except he deſire and affectionatly waite for Gods preſence, and aſſiſtance with him in the executiou of his charge, to be able to do all things in his name; for if he doth not this, he doth renounce his dependance upon his Soveraign, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tenor of his Commiſſion, he takes upon him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his power in his own name, which makes him <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> to forfeit all his right to his place.</p>
                           <p>Theſe maximes are clearly to be inferred from the matter and order of the parts of <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſt Truths in themſelves, I ſhall not inſiſt to prove them, but proceed to other obſervations.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">How he may be ſure of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with himſelf in his place.</note>4. That no Magiſtrate can hope for Gods preſence with him, or ſucceſſe in his publick place: who doth not walk in his houſe privatly ſo with his familiars, as to keep his heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect towards God. Fot if his heart be moſt upright towards God in ſecret, it will never be intire in publick concernments; and if his life and perſonall carriage at home be not exemplary, it will never be juſt and without offence abroad. This maxime alſo doth clearly follow upon the latter part of <hi>Davids</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">By taking care aſwell of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill, as of doing good.</note>5. That the care which Magiſtrates ſhould take for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ought not to be onely for good purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſhould be proſecuted: but it muſt alſo be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the apprehenſion, and prevention of evils which are incident unto the ſtations of men in publick places, that they may be prudently avoided.</p>
                           <p>This maxime as it is clearly in it ſelf a true Rule of Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: ſo it is evidently, to be inferred from the matter of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> reſolution in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. compared with that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>6. That Magiſtrates looking to the evils incident to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men in publick places, to prevent the ſame ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the two fountains thereof; Namely, their owne
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:163962:79"/> irregular deſignes from within, and the works of men that turn aſide cleaving to them without. For as theſe are the two evils which <hi>David</hi> reſolves to free himſelf from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. ſo they are dangers more eminently incident to Magiſtrates than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">Firſt in their own ſtations.</note> Firſt, Magiſtrates are more liable to be tempted to diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes (the text cals this to ſet matters of <hi>Belial</hi> before their eyes) than other men: becauſe of their places; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as they are free from the yoak of fear which others muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, who are accountable to their Superiours of their waies: ſo by reaſon of the power which they have over others, they are more ſuſceptible of pride, of ſelf-conceitedneſſe, of being flattered into licentious reſolutions of freedom; and to reſentments of injuries, and ſo to be tranſported to deſignes which are not orderly, but againſt or above the Laws which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſubject unto.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Magiſtrates are more liable to be acceſſary to the guilt of other mens ſins, than men of privat places: for evill and diſſolute men, who ſtudy nothing but voluptuouſneſs, make it their whole work to creep into favour about them, and ſubtile men, who ſtudy nothing but profit and greatnes, oft-times to the prejudice of the meaner ſort, by oppreſſive waies, inſinuate themſelves alſo about them, if they then authorize and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance theſe in their deſignes, either openly by commands, or ſubtily by wincking at them, and giving them a ſhelter; the guilt of all ſuch mens wickedneſſe doth cleave unto them. For not onely theſe whoſe life it is wholly to depend upon thoſe that are in power; but alſo all other men that are under their charge, bring guilt upon them, and make them acceſſary to ſin, except they repreſſe and reprove the evill which they find in them, nnd ſhew their hatred againſt all thoſe that turne aſide from the direct way of godlineſſe and honeſty, of juſtice and ſobriety.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">Then alſo in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 7. That Magiſtrates walk not in a perfect way in reſpect of their places, although they free both themſelves and their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants from evill; except they alſo take notice of others that are without, to oppoſe the vicious, and advance the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both in private and publick occaſions.</p>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:163962:80"/>
                           <p>This axiome is evident from the whole matter of <hi>Davids</hi> profeſſion, eſpecially from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. till the end: and the reaſon of it will appear if the nature and motion of a perfect way, be compared with the nature &amp; motion of a Magiſtrates place; for the place of a Magiſtrate is wholly relative and towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; except therefore his way be perfect againſt evill, and for good in teference to others, it doth not anſwer his place: and except it be ſo as well in private as in publick, it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for although a good man may be an ill Magiſtrate for want of Ruling parts; yet no man that is ill can be a good Magiſtate, though his parts be never ſo eminent. Becauſe an evill man, as he makes no conſcience of ſin in private, ſo he will never be zealous for vertue, nor againſt vice in publick: All that he will do, will be onely for himſelf, to ſave his owne credit, that he may not be cryed out againſt; For if his heart be evill. he hath no love to Judgement and Mercy, as they are works good to all, as they are acceptable to God who hath commanded them, and as they are proper to his place of Rule; but onely as they make a ſhew before men, and ſerve ro keep up his reputation amongſt them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">By cutting off the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible,</note> 8. That by oppoſing vice in others privatly and publickly, Magiſtrates do not enough to remove the wicked from places of Truſt, and to ſhew their diſlike of men; except alſo they uſe meanes to cut them off from the ſociety over which they are ſet, and eſpecially if they be found incorrigible.</p>
                           <p>This is plainly <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, in his perfect way of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 7. &amp; 8.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">Eſpecially of foure ſorts</note> 9. That Magiſtrates walking in their places in a perfect way, ſhould take notice as well of thoſe that plot perverſe deſignes, as of thoſe that put them in execution; but amongſt all theſe the ſlanderer, the proud, the deceiver and the lyar, are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be hunted out of all places of truſt, and caſt out of the Common-wealth; for theſe foure may be compared to the wheeles of Satans Chariot, on which he rides through the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of mankind, to diſturbe the Peace and Happineſſe, by the corruption of our nature, which Magiſtrates are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to curb and reſiſt. This is that which <hi>David</hi> reſolves upon in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. &amp; 7. and by experience we find that without the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:163962:80"/> diſcovery and removall of theſe foure ſorts of wicked men, there can be no Peace and quietneſſe in humaine Societies.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">By ſeeking out, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</note> 10. That the way of a Magiſtrate is not perfect although he thus oppoſe vice, except he alſo ſeek out thoſe that are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and make uſe of them for privat and publick occaſions of employment.</p>
                           <p>This is manifeſtly <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way of Magiſtracy can no more ſubſiſt without the uſe of good inſtruments, than conſiſt with the employment of evill ones: as therefore the removing of the one is neceſſary, ſo is the finding out and calling of the other: nor can there be a greater cauſe of corruption in Civill Government, than the want of care to finde out and employ vertuous men therein.</p>
                           <p>11. That no man ought to be intruſted with any acceſſe, or privacy about the Magiſtrate, but he that is faithfull in the Land; and no man employed by him in any ſervice, but he that is upright in his way.</p>
                           <p>
                              <label>And how that ſhould be done.</label> Theſe are the two Characters of perſons, whom <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ſeek out and call to himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and till Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates make it a chief maxime of State to follow his example herein, it will never go well with them in their Government. It is not he who commends himſelf, &amp; that is offered by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of friends unto a place; but he whom God commends by his abilities, and ſuch Characters as theſe who is fit to be employed it were greatly to be wiſhed; if it could alſo be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that theſe who have the diſpoſall of places, would make it an unalterable maxime of State, to reject all ſutors for places, and to admit of none but whom they themſelves ſhould chuſe, and call upon the diſcovery of their abilities, and of theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters found in them: Namely, that they are <hi>faithfull in the Land, and perfect in their way.</hi> He is faithfull in the Land, who is true to the publick good thereof; who hath not ſought his own private advantage, before the intereſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: ſuch a one may be truſted with a publick place, that he will not abuſe it for his own ends; and he is perfect in his way, whoſe courſe of life is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and conſcionable; and who is carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:163962:81"/> his integrity without offence towards all. If none but ſuch were ſought out for publick places, the affairs of States and Common-wealths, would indeed be ſucceſsfull; but as long, as the maximes and intereſts of factions and parties (which all along deſtroy humane ſocieties) are followed, and private aimes bear rule over the ſpirits of thoſe that rule in a State; theſe characters of men fit for places will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, nor the courſe to chuſe and call thereunto taken up by any.</p>
                           <p>12. That the aime of a godly and wiſe Magiſtrate is, not to ſerve himſelf in his place but others: nor his ultimate end, to ſerve others ſo much in their temporall conveniences, as to protect the City of God, and free it from the diſturbance of Gods ſervice and all cauſes of trouble.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin" type="runSum">And why he ought mainly to intend this.</note> This is profeſſedly <hi>Davids</hi> end in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and if we firſt look upon a Magiſtrate as Gods ſubſtitute and Deputy; and then if we grant that no Deputy can be counted faithfull to him that hath deputed him, except he mainly intend that which his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour doth aime at: then this cannot be denied, that the Magiſtrates ultimate end, muſt needs be the ſafety and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the City of the Lord; for God having created all for his own glory, hath given the world unto Chriſt; and Chriſt having Redeemed all for the glory of his Father, hath given all to his Church, where God doth dwell with men. So that for the Churches ſake which is the City of God, all Government is maintained and appointed by God in the world; If then a Magiſtrate doth not deſigne his paines to protect this City, and make it free from the moleſtation of wicked doers, he doth not fulfill the mind of God in his place; and is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himſelf wiſely in a perfect way, that he fals ſhort of the main end of his employment, and will be circumvented by the folly of his own deceitfulneſſe; for God will certainly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturne, be-foole and diſappoint all the contrivances of men, though never ſo crafty and powerfull, which are not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto this great end of ſetting up his Sonne: and he will turne out of their places all Magiſtrates and Governours of the Nations, which Rule the World onely for themſelves, or for temporall advantages, rather than for the conveniency
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:163962:81"/> and protection of his Citie: if we beleeve that Chriſt hath a rod of Iron in his hand; and that he is now daſhing all the Nations in pieces, and turning the Rulers thereof out of their way, who have not kiſſed and ſerved him with fear; we ought to be ſo wiſe as to conſider that at laſt no intereſt but that of Chriſtianity will hold out.</p>

                           <p>Let Magiſtrates then, if they deſire to ſtand, learn to underſtand this intereſt, what it is: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will preſerve them from danger but the maintaining of it; becauſe nothing can direct them in a way pleaſing to God, and permanently good, but what is anſwerable to theſe Rules, and leads to this end. And who is ſo blind as not to ſee, that the not obſerving of theſe Rules by thoſe that were in places of government over us, and the miſſing of this end, hath brought all theſe changes and alterations upon them and us? And therefore it is a certain and eaſie prognoſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay; That if thoſe who now govern us, take not up theſe Rules and Maximes of State to govern juſtly themſelves under God, and us thereby; but think to doe all their will by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their ſword, they will aſſuredly find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

                              <p>Now to bring this matter yet neerer home, to the purpoſe in hand; I ſuppoſe that none is able to deny this, That God hath given to thoſe that are now over us in places of Rule, a conqueſt of all that have hitherto oppoſed them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; and to call them conquerours of the State that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was, as I conceive it no injury to themſelves, nor reproach to the conquered, nor diſparagement to us that are under the power of their conqueſt (ſeeing it is manifeſtly Gods will it ſhould be ſo, and who can reverſe it?) ſo I hope that God who hath ſet them up, will incline their hearts to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as his inſtruments in their places to be conquered by the perfect way of his Rule; that therein by the law of Love, they may conquer all ſuch as feare his judgements, and hate not thereby to be reformed.

For I take this to be a cleare Rule in Chriſtianity, Whatſoever I ought to pray for, I ought alſo to procure and labour for by all the meanes I can in the way of my calling. Now ſome of the meanes by which I can in the way of my calling help to procure the grace I pray for unto them, are theſe:</p>
                              <p>1. That I ſhould make my paths ſtraight towards them,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:163962:82"/> giving them no cauſe of offence in any thing, leſt my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Goſpel be blamed.</p>

                              <p>3. That I ſhould follow peace and holineſſe with them, and conſequently not ſet my ſelfe to ſtrive obſtinatly againſt them; farre leſſe to oppoſe them even in things that are juſt before God and Man, and neceſſary to preſerve common ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quietneſſe.</p>
                              <p>4. That I ſhould look carefully to them, to be able when God doth give me opportunity, to inſtruct, exhort and warn them, leſt any faile of the grace of God, and walk not worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called: For by theſe means God peradventure may make me a good inſtrument, and a veſſell of honour in his own hand towards them, if I be purged from the earthly diſtempers of humane paſſions. And what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhould ſee no great appearance of being received by them, in that which I offer and mean well, according to the Goſpel? What although I ſhould perceive no redreſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but rather an increaſe of publick troubles and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances? What although all hopes of peace and ſettlement ſhould more and more flye from us? ſhould I therefore leave off to do my duty? ſhall I ceaſe to pray for thoſe that are over me? ſhall I not endeavour that they may know Gods wil in their places, and receive grace to doe it? ſhall I be weary of well doing towards all? I hope none will adviſe this. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not need to ſcruple a compliance and concurrence with any, in things juſt and lawfull in themſelves. For let the Title of thoſe that ſtand now with power in the places of Rule, be what it will, whether it be called a conqueſt of the former ſtate yea or no? and whether as Conquerours they may juſtly claim all the rights which the State could pretend unto yea or no? Or whether it be a vindication of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power and liberty in the body of a Nation from the hands of thoſe that had enſlaved it yea or no? Or whether it be the neceſſity of a naturall defence of the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:163962:83"/> of the people, againſt thoſe that by power ſeek ſtill to invade the ſame yea or no? Or whether it be (as ſome terme it) an irregular uſurpation and abuſe of power and truſt in thoſe that are ſervants to make themſelves maſters yea or no? or what Title ſoever elſe may be given to their ruling ſtate and power; it maketh no matter to me in reſpect of Chriſtianity, and thoſe fore-named duties; becauſe in Chriſtianity thoſe are duties which I muſt intend without reſpect of perſons, at all times, and towards all men (except I can truly judge that they have ſinned the ſin unto death, which I hope none will judge of theſe) for ſuppoſe as to men, that their ſtanding had no place, and ſhould be thought not onely in reſpect of the Nationall, but even of naturall lawes, altogether unjuſt: yet if I muſt look upon them as they are by Gods permiſſion and direction ſet up; and from him; if I find them, as over me, in places of Government; ſo ſuch in whoſe hand he hath put the full adminiſtration of his power over the whole Nation, I muſt conclude that by vertue of his command, I am bound to pray for them, that they may have grace to manage their Power and Talents rightly, according to his will, and for the good of the Nation, and for the City of God therein: for whoſe ſake alſo I ought to aſſiſt them with my beſt abilities received for publick ſervice, to inable them ſo to doe. Upon this account therefore I wiſh from my heart, that every one of them may be in their lives and charges as perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way of God, as <hi>David</hi> was, and as zealous to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance all good, and deſtroy all wicked doers from the Citie of the Lord, as he profeſſeth himſelfe to be. What ever the title and claim to right may be in others, who ſtand as competitors with, or againſt thoſe that are in poſſeſſion, I take not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to determine either way: no man hath made me a judge or a divider of rights between the great ones of the world; my way in the Goſpel is to prejudge none in that which God hath given them, but to ſerve all through love in that which is good: As for that right which God doth give to power (<hi>For the moſt high of all ruleth in the Kingdome of</hi>

As for my ſelfe, my whole work is to judge of mine own wayes how to keep them pure and without offence towards all, how to hold forth the word of life, and thereby to ſtirre up every one to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of Chriſt Ieſus, by walking in love as he hath loved us, and in holineſſe as he is holy, and how to follow peace, and reconcile differences which are deſtructive to Church and State, in a Goſpell-way, chiefly when God doth open a doore of utterance unto me; and this is all that I am to meddle withall in my place and calling; and as I hope without humane reſpects and worldly ends, never to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this; ſo beyond this line, nor conſideration, no man nor thing, God willing, ſhall ever draw me. It is a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me, what any may think or ſay of my preſent medling in this buſineſſe and this way, yet I ſhall never refuſe to give a true reaſon to any that ſhall diſcreetly ſeek it, of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but to anſwer the partiall cavils and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which paſſionatly ſelfe-willed and conceited men ſhall intend to put upon my actions, I ſhall alwayes think it below my care and Calling, and regard it no more than the noyſe of a Dogges barking.</p>

                        <p>And theſe expreſſions I have here inſerted, concerning my ſelf by way of digreſſion, not only to ſhew the true grounds by which I am led, thus to judge and act within my Sphere; but alſo to obviat ſomething in the mindes of ſome men, which is obſtructive to the entertaining of theſe impartial ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions in Goſpel-ſimplicitie; as at this time offered without any further deſigne (for curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully) and finally to make it apparent, that I am neither ignorant nor imprudently careleſs, nor afraid of<note place="margin" type="runSum">The intent of the digreſſion </note> the thoughts of men concerning my ſelf; nor unaware of the imaginations which ſome will entertaine concerning that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:163962:84"/> which I have ſaid already, and that which now I am entring upon to ſay, which ſhall referre to a mutuall correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which ought to be between the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Rulers of this, and of every Chriſtian State. For ſeeing the laſt Aphoriſme which I have drawn from <hi>Davids Directory,</hi> concerning the aime of a wiſe and godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, doth lead me as it were by the hand, unto this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof the conſideration is as neceſſarie for our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as any thing hitherto ſpoken of; I ſhould be very much grieved that my Brethren of the Miniſtery, by a miſtake of duty, and prepoſterouſneſſe of zeale againſt thoſe that are over them with power in the State, ſhould neceſſitate them through their unruly and implacable misbehaviours, to take up deſignes for their own and the publick ſafety, wherein neither we, nor they themſelves will have any cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing: or that they ſhould divert them from the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereunto hopefully they may be fully carried, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclined thereunto by their own principles. For I know no probable reaſon to think, that they ſhould not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to performe the perfect duty of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, and follow <hi>Davids</hi> example therein, when they are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, that their ultimate end muſt not be ſo much to ſerve themſelves and others in temporall matters, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the City of GOD from all anoyances of the wicked of this world: for that is <hi>Davids</hi> meaning when he ſaith in the concluſion of this Pſalme, that <hi>He will early deſtroy all the wicked of the Land, that he may cut off all wicked doers from the Citie of the LORD.</hi> Where it evidenty doth appeare, that the laſt effect of his endeavours in his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, was to procure the well being of the Church of GOD, by the wayes of power and authority, which God hath put into his hand. And if ſo, then theſe Corollaries will follow as I conceive, concerning the power and duty of the Magiſtrate.</p>

                           <head>The grounds upon which it is hoped.</head>
                           <p>1. That to the Magiſtrate a coercive power of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth belong both in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                           <p>2. That no perſons may pretend any exemption from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Therefore we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if there be no amiable correſpondency ſought, but a manifeſt diviſion maintained between theſe two, that our publicke diſeaſes will become abſolutely incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and that this ſymptome thereof will be fatall to this State.</p>

                           <p>For except a Cure can be found unto this breach, how can there be any true healing of other breaches, or prevention of future Calamities hoped for? will not from hence inevitably follow a perpetual increaſe of animoſities and offences on all ſides, and from thence an endleſs ſequel of judgements? and will not God deſtroy all thoſe that are acceſſary to the Cauſes of ſuch evils, except they prevent him by repentance? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to compleat the application of the forenamed Remedies, which we have found to be ſpecifical to our Diſeaſes; nothing can be thought upon more uſeful nor ſo neceſſary, than to work out and procure this correſpondency; for as without the Concurrence of theſe two hands, there can be no ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or advancement of any publick undertakings: So with their joynt ſtrength and cooperation in this way of God, we may confidently hope that the works of our Reformation may be ſpeedy, ſafe, full, and permanent.</p>

                              <p>If Conſcience ſhould be reflected upon, and conſulted withall, in reſpect of the inducements which ſhould equally move Chriſtian Magiſtrates and godly Miniſters to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond together in the diſcharge of their publick duties, three things will be found conſiderable to them both. 1. Their joynt relation unto God, who hath put them both in their publick places as his ſervants. 2. The great intereſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which he hath mainly recommended unto them both. 3. The immediate ends of their mutuall correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which are theſe two; the purifying of the City of God from all wickedneſſe: and the ſtrengthning of each others hands in going about that work: both which things they are equally obliged in the preſence of God to intend. If therefore any weak voice could reach unto them both at once, I would with due reſpect ſay thus; if either of you do mind the great Lord and Maſter under whom you ſtand, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did; if to him you judge your ſelves to be fellow-ſervants, equally accountable as well of your mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all willingneſſe to concur in his ſervice, as of any other duty; if you think the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie a buſineſſe worth the owning, and a work incumbent to your charges, that you ſhould uphold and advance it as well joyntly, as ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: if the well being of the City of God, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Iſrael, be at all a deſigne to be thought upon by you; and if you can rationally conceive, that your amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concurrence will be highly helpfull towards theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; and that the want thereof will be as great an obſtruction as any that can befall thereunto; then I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you that are upright in heart, and that underſtand what ſuch engagements mean, that upon the conſideration thereof, you would ſhew your ſelves conſcionably loving, and inclinable to a correſpondencie: but if you will not lay this duty to heart, nor make uſe of the intereſt which ye have in each other for the ſervice of the Lord: <hi>My ſoul ſhall weep in</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:163962:86"/> underſtood to be obligatorie; or being underſtood, are not thought upon; or being thought upon (at leaſt now in this extremitie, and thus repreſented) are not at all effectuall to make any impreſſion towards your duty, how can you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your hearts before God, or think that your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath any ſoundneſſe? I do not hereby make my ſelf a Judge of any mans Conſcience; every man ſhall ſtand and fall to his own Maſter: but if this which I bear witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is a truth, then I muſt diſcharge mine own conſcience in the preſence of God, and give warning unto thoſe whom it may concern of the danger of this neglect of duty, to exhort every one to look to his own conſcience, leſt it be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep under the guilt of this unſociableneſſe, which being manifeſtly broke forth amongſt us, the guilt thereof muſt needs reſt ſomewhere. Wherefore alſo it followeth, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is bound to look to himſelf, leſt ſin be found lying, and reſting at his doore. For when Chriſt told his diſciples that one of them ſhould betray him, they all fell to a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of themſelves, and enquired of him alſo; <hi>Is it I Maſter, is it I?</hi> Let us do the like in this caſe; for it is evident, that if this neglect of duty doth continue long, ſome of us will therein betray the publick profeſſion of the Goſpel, and with it the ſafetie of the State into the hands of our adverſaries: and this ſcrutiny ſhould be the more earneſtly heeded, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe that are in publick places; becauſe the means and wayes to beget a good correſpondency, and to make it effectuall towards the healing of our breaches are not very difficult, but may without trouble be ſet afoot ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: as now I ſhall ſhew, if there be no unwillingneſſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the ſame.</p>

                              <p>To beget then a correſpondencie which will be no leſſe ſufficient to do our work of Reformation, then neceſſarie to preſerve us from ruine, I conceive three things muſt be thought upon. 1. Firſt, by what means a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may henceforth be begotten between Magiſtrates and Miniſters in order to common deſires. 2. By what means a concurrence may be framed in all preſent undertakings
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:163962:86"/> towards publick aimes. 3. And by what means the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which ſhall be undertaken may become effectd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: for except theſe three things be found, and agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the godly parties at a diſtance, I can ſee no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of this performance of their duty. For if there be no good intelligence, nor right underſtanding between them in reference to common deſires, how can there be any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence either in the communication of counſels, or in the undertaking of endevours? And if no confidence be found between thoſe that ſhould act together in theſe things, how ſhall their concurrence be wrought? or being brought about, continue, and become ſucceſſefull? But if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and the Magiſtracy, as the two hands by which God doth lead the inward and outward man, unto eternall and temporall felicitie, be brought by his grace and Spirit, to underſtand one anothers deſires and deſignes aright, they will be glad to joyn, and readily concur to heal all breaches to rectifie their own mutuall miſtakes, and to prevent the further increaſe of publick diſtempers in others: nor will they lead any more the ſtreames of peoples affections, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been done, either into oppoſite, or into different channels; which is altogether inconſiſtent with the good of the Common-wealth, and deſtructive to their mutuall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in each other.</p>
                              <p>Theſe mediums then towards the procurement of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencie are evidently neceſſarie, but how they may be had, ſeems a difficulty; and truly as things now ſtand, I cannot ſay that the procurement thereof is no difficulty at all: but this I may confidently ſay, that if Chriſtianity be reſpected amongſt us, or Morall and Prudentiall honeſtie, more then worldly aimes and policies, there will be no great difficultie in the buſineſſe: yet in this deliberation I ſhall not preſume to preſcribe my ſenſe unto any; but ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer unto the conſideration of all, that which I conceive moſt agreeable, both unto reaſon, and to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:163962:87"/> order to common deſires, let us ſearch into the properties thereof to ſee what they are, and how they may be found out. What then are, or ought to be the common deſires and deſignes of Chriſtian Magiſtrates and Goſpel Miniſters? are they not the thoughts of procuring towards the Church and State, the beſt things which belong to their charges? and wherein all other things are comprehended, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none other enjoyments will be profitable or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I ſuppoſe none will doubt of this. But then what are theſe things which are thus qualified? certainly they muſt be things undiſputably good, of themſelves deſirable, fully known to all in Chriſtianity, abſolutely neceſſarie to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, indifferently uſefull to the good of all; and which being obtained none other profitable things will be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſociety of mankinde: and of this kinde two things there are (as I conceive) which comprehend the reſt, <hi>viz:</hi> Godlineſſe and Honeſtie, whereunto is ſubſervient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionableneſſe and Rationality. The way then to beget a<note place="margin" type="runSum">What theſe common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhould be.</note> good underſtanding in order to common deſires between Magiſtrates and Miniſters, whoſe proper work it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the welfare of the ſocieties wherein they are joyntly placed, can be none other but this; that they ſhould both ſet before their eyes the advancement of theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their people, and endevour to ſtrengthen each other in the furtherance thereof, to the end that towards them all ſafetie, peace and plentie may be ſetled thereby, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: for without the grounds of Piety and conſcionable dealing in things pertaining to God, and of honeſtie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall dealing in things pertaining to men, it is not poſſible that the bleſſings of conſtant ſafetie, peace, and plentie can be procured unto any Nation of the world: becauſe no true vertues, either of religiouſneſſe, or of humane induſtrie, (without which no publick happineſſe can befall to any Nation) can be cultivated, and propagated amongſt men, except the principles of godlineſſe and honeſtie, of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onableneſſe and rationalitie be maintained, and advanced towards them. Except therefore Magiſtrates and Miniſters profeſſedly joyn in theſe deſignes, and intend to raiſe all

That in all ſuch meetings the ſupream Authority ſhould depute ſome body to be in their name preſent at them; to give countenance and authority to their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; to aſſiſt the Miniſtery in outward matters with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and advice; or alſo in other things as may be requiſite and deſired, (though in particular matters it will not at all be expedient, that the State Deputy ſhould either debate or vote) to take notice of all things that come before them; and of their orderly and decent carriage about the ſame, to ſee that they meddle not with Sate matters, or deſignes of another kinde, then ſuch as tend to the Spirituall edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſouls, and finally to make report to thoſe by whom he is deputed; of every thing relating to the publick conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their affairs; or which otherwiſe are obſervable for the welfare of the Church and State. Thus the Magiſtrate may concurre with the Miniſtery in their preſent underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:163962:89"/> the Miniſters may concurre alſo reciprocally with the Magiſtrate in his preſent undertakings, if they be called by him thereunto: and as the Magiſtrate in his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about Church affairs doth go no further then the Sphere of his calling doth permit, ſo the Miniſters being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by him to give aſſiſtance in State buſineſſes, ſhould not exceed the proper ſphere of their employment; therefore if a doubtfull caſe of conſcience ſhould fall in about State deliberations; I conceive, that (as elſewhere the cuſtom is, ſo here, the matter may be propoſed unto ſome of them, without acquainting them with all the particulars of State concernments relating thereunto: but onely with that which is doubtfull as to conſcience in reſpect of Gods will, concealing the reſt as Lawyers uſe to do when they propoſe matters under the names of <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Caius.</hi>

My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the ſpirituall and temporall adminiſtrations, the one relating to the inward, the other to the outward man, ſhould not be confounded and jumbled together, without any diſtinction of their bounds; and made to run out of their own channels into each others: becauſe if this fall out, both will loſe their efficacie towards their objects, in the application of publick remedies to the ſpirits of men.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:163962:90"/> For if the Magiſtrate ſhould take upon him the work of<note place="margin" type="runSum">where, 1 Of irregular undertakings and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> the Miniſtery whereunto God hath not appointed him, he cannot hope for a bleſſing from him, becauſe he is out of his calling: nor will the ſpirits of men to whom he offers himſelf as a Miniſter, receive him as ſuch, but will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and confounded in their relation towards him. The Ordinances of the Miniſtery and Magiſtracy are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all knowing men to be diſtinct in Gods hand, and that each ought to be reſpected by it ſelf, and in its own way uſed: now if he who is ſet up to be the preſident and protector of all publick order, ſhould confound them, and become the authour of diſorder, in his main buſineſſe, he weakens his own reputation, and makes his works void, for the mindes of men who reſpect the Miniſtery by it ſelf for their ſpirituall works ſake. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 13. and the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by it ſelf for their temporall works ſake: <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5. will be obſtructed to every thing which he doth in that kind, becauſe to them he acts neither as a Magiſtrate, nor as a Miniſter, and ſo doth make himſelf uſeleſſe. Nor will Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in ſuch a caſe being concerned in their places be idle; nor will it be poſſible to take off the affections of men from looking towards them, whether they be ſuperſtitiouſly or judiciouſly affected with the Ordinance, where of neceſſity they will be diſtracted; when in the ſame work they ſee Miniſters act one way, and Magiſtrates another: which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in their proceedings, muſt needs make all their undertakings ineffectuall.</p>
                              <p>In like manner if the Miniſter ſhould take upon him the work of the Magiſtrate, whereunto God hath not appointed him, he cannot expect Gods preſence with him in it; becauſe he is out of the place where God hath ſet him, and out of the employment whereunto the promiſe is made, <hi>Behold I am with you alway till the end of the world.</hi> Matth. 28. 19, 20. Nor is it fit that the Magiſtrate ſhould ſuffer another to uſurp his place, nor ought a Miniſter of Chriſt to be buſie in other mens matters: nor is it juſt that he ſhould fiſh in other mens waters, with their angling rod and baits without their leave: nor can the people, to whom a Miniſter, doth in this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:163962:90"/> way apply himſelf, receive him in the ſimplicity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as a ſervant of Chriſt, ſeeing he doth not apply himſelf unto them by the Spirit of Chriſt, and in things belonging to his kingdom; but as a man, and in the affairs of this world, wherein they are not ſubordinate unto him, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higher powers, which as to them in this reſpect are made void and uſeleſſe. Whence it will unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that about the performance of their duties, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of their relations, their ſpirits will be diſtracted, this way and that way; when both Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters act each others parts, &amp; offer themſelves with different or contrary influences towards them about the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

The reaſons which move me to make this doubt, and for which I would have the matter layed to heart, by thoſe to whom the Ruling power over us is committed, are briefly theſe. If the end for which Miniſters are made uſe of in this matter, be onely to have the Act of State notified to the people at a ſolemne meeing, I conceive this end may be gained as well if not better, by obliging any ſubordinate officer who can read diſtinctly, to do it in the Magiſtrates name, (as elſe <note n="*" place="margin">viz: Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> where the cuſtome is) at the ſame time of publick meeting; either before the Miniſter goes into the Pulpit, or aftes he is come
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:163962:91"/> out of it: for it is more proper, that the Magiſtrate ſhould make one of his own Officers of State, an Herald of his Acts and Ordinances towards his Subjects, then that this ſhould be impoſed upon him, whom Chriſt hath called, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to be the Herald of his kingdome onely, and not to meddle with Matters of State, eſpecially then, when he is about the proper work of his ſervice. The mixture of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and Spirituall concernments is not anſwerable to the Rule of the Miniſteriall Calling; and if the opportunity of the place, and time of publick meeting be mainly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſay, that all publick places, and ſolemne meetings are more immediately, and directly ſubordinate unto, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon, the Magiſtrates appointment, then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and therefore may be made uſe of by him, for his own occaſions, as he ſhall think fit; without ſeeking leave of the Miniſter: nay, it is clear, that the Miniſter hath no right to the place, or the publickneſſe of the meeting, without the Magiſtrates leave; and therefore hath no ſuch property in his Pulpit, or holineſſe annexed to it, that none but himſelf may uſe it; or nothing elſe but what he will allow, may be declared in it.</p>
                              <p>But if the end of obliging the Miniſters to this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of State Acts, be not ſo much the bare publication ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the people in the Magiſtrates name (which certainly is more proper for his own Officer to do) but a deſigne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to engage the Miniſter to recommend the buſineſſe it ſelf, which he is required to publiſh; or to diſcover his want of affection towards it, that upon that ſcore he may be dealt withall: then under favour I think that this deſigne both wayes is extremely irregular, and conſequently prejudiciall to the welfare of the State. For ſo many inconveniencies ariſe both wayes, unto the quiet, ſafetie, and ſettlement of the Government in righteouſneſſe, and to the reſpect due to the Magiſtrate by their Subjects, and to the Goſpel-work of the Miniſtery, that they ſcarſe can all be reckoned up. For firſt, in reſpect of the deſigne of engaging the Miniſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the people the acts of State; I conceive it, under favour, to be very inconſiſtent with the Prudency of a State
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:163962:92"/> ſo to do: for although, for the time, the particular buſineſſe may be advanced, and the Miniſter may ſeem well affected to the Magiſtrate, and ſo make his acts conſiderable towards the people: yet by this way of proceeding there is more loſt in the main Authority of the Magiſtrate, and in the right way of ſetling it to the advantage of Government, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times; then is gained by the affecting of any particular buſineſſe: for let the buſineſſe be what it will, the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and recommendation of it, is but a tranſient action in the Miniſter, and if the matter of the Act of State like him well; perhaps he may do it heartily; if not, perhaps coldly: but the impreſſion which that action naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, and leaves in the minde both of the people, and of worldly minded Miniſters is not tranſient; but permanent to the great diſadvantage and diminution of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates juſt Authority and due reſpect: for this his publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Magiſtrates Acts with a recommendation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſignifies to the people, that without the Miniſters appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and allowance of his proceedings, they are not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and conſequently that the Miniſtery is to be lookt upon as the laſt judge of their Magiſtraticall determinations; and that obedience is not to be yeelded, ſo much, becauſe it is his Act of State, as becauſe the Miniſter hath recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to them: And thus the Miniſter comes between them and home, in the ſubjects thoughts; and that upon no irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grounds: for if the Magiſtrate himſelf truſts not his own Authority, and right to command what is juſt, but muſt borrow the help of the Miniſtery towards the carrying on of State buſineſſes: then it followeth rationally, that in State matters Miniſters muſt be conſidered as well as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and in ſomewhat more then they; ſeeing the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all accompliſhment of buſineſſes is referred unto them by the Magiſtrate himſelf: and without them the people are brought into a cuſtome not to receive it. And I verily beleeve, that this ratiocination upon this prepoſterous employment of Miniſters, doth not onely work that impreſſion upon the people, whereby the Ruling Power is degraded from what it ſhould be in their eſteeme; but even Miniſters themſelves
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:163962:92"/> (whoſe minds are not towards their own work in ſimplioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and without worldly wiſdome) are raiſed to intereſt themſelves in the management of State deſigns; and to make themſelves conſiderable, and in a manner collaterall, either for the buſineſſe, as Aſſiſtants; or againſt the ſame, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulers: for by what rule and right they are employed, or called to be aſſiſtants in a work, by the ſame, if they like it not, they may become controulers thereof. And if they may not publickly towards the people, be controulers of the Magiſtrates State proceedings in what they like not; I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be obliged to become his heralds, and adjutators, in what they like. They are ſuppoſed to be free Agents; and if the Magiſtrate in his place, and againſt the nature of it makes himſelf ſo inconſiderable, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unable to do his buſineſſe without them, he makes himſelf in the thoughts both of the people, and of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters themſelves (who aſpire unto the world) dependant upon them in his adminiſtrations; and ſo gives them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to preſume above the meaſure of the Rule which Chriſt hath ſet for their employment.</p>
                              <p>By this irregular and prepoſterous improvement of the Miniſteriall intereſt in the affections of the ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for wordly ends; Antichriſt did of old get his foot into the ſtirrop of worldly power, and made the Kings and Emperours of the earth hold it for him till he got on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; and ever ſince he hath kept the ſaddle, and rid the beaſts, at his pleaſure, till of late by the light of the Goſpel, ſome that were his beaſts, are become men; and have caſt him out of their ſaddle to the ground under their feet: and it is hoped that God will open the eyes of all to do the like, till his uſurped greatneſſe vaniſh out of the world.</p>
                              <p>And this much in brief, of the inconveniencies following naturally upon the recommendation of State matters to the people in the pulpit, when Miniſters are affectionate and hearty thereunto: but if they be diſaffected and not hearty to this buſineſſe; either becauſe they refuſe to give in all things due reſpect unto the Power which requires it of them: or becauſe they have ſome other ſcruple in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:163962:93"/> perhaps in reſpect of the matter to be publiſhed which they underſtand not to be juſt and right, and cannot allow; and conſequently cannot publiſh, perhaps (although the matter may be without exception, yet) in reſpect of the end and deſigne wherefore it is to be publiſhed, which they may ſuſpect, and will contribute nothing unto: and perhaps (although there be nothing of all this, yet) in reſpect of their own relation towards ſuch an employment, &amp; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which it may ſeem to bring upon the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, which their conſcience cannot ſtand under: whether their ſcruple doth ariſe from any, or from all of theſe conſiderations; ſo many, and ſo great inconvencies may beſhewed, from thence to redound to the quiet of the State, and to the repute of the ſuperiour powers in the hearts of their ſubjects; that if it were needfull (as it is not) to enlarge my ſelf upon this ſubject, and go to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars comprehended under theſe heads, a competent treatiſe might by it ſelf, be written thereof, to ſhew the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this practiſe to the well being of a Common wealth: whereas on the other ſide, by the preſſing of that practiſe towards the diſaffected thereunto, nothing is to be found of advantage (if yet that be at all any advantage) but this; that ſome kind of diſcoverie is made upon ſome men, of an appearance of diſaffectedneſſe in them towards the wayes of the State: which kinde of diſcoverie the true prudencie of ſober States men, will teach them rather to prevent and conceale; then to lay open before the world. (for what advantage is it to me, to let all my adverſaries know, who they are that diſaffect my wayes? is not this a manifeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, and diſadvantage to my affairs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute?) And then alſo the rule of Chriſtian wiſdom and generoſity, leads the diſciples of Chriſt, to overcome and conquer by well doing the ſecret diſaffectedneſſe of mens ſpirits againſt us, rather then to hunt after a diſcoverie thereof: or to purſue them with ill will for it; when it is found out: it was the laſt plot, and higheſt attempt of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall perſecution, which immediately went before their overthrow, to dive into the diſaffectedneſſe of Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:163962:93"/> againſt their wayes, by putting them upon the reading of the book of ſports on the Lords day in obedience to the King: but by that diſcoverie God did take them in their own ſnare, and diſcovering to all men their ſhamefull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, he did thereby caſt both them and the Authority of the late thing upon which they ſo much ſtood in that matter, out of the rationall eſteem not onely of Godly but even of Morally honeſt men: therefore I would not wiſh any godly States-men to imitate this kind of Policie, or think to gain any thing by it; ſeeing it is ſo contrary both to the rule of Chriſtianity, and to ſound reaſon in State affairs. And beſides all this, as in it ſelf it is a point of the higheſt Tyrannicall oppreſſion and cruelty, to intend a perſecution againſt mens perſons; who are otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive in all their curriages, becauſe their ſecret affections are not ſuch towards us, as we would have them; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot ſubmit their judgements and ſpirits to every thing which we would have ſet up over them: Nor did in effect <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> any thing elſe when he ſet up his Image to be worſhipped, but this; which in a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is aimed at by thoſe who will mainly preſſe this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by ſetting up leſſer State images to be reſpected: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſought this very thing, to know what all mens ſecret affections were to his wayes, that whoſoever ſhould be found ſo ſtout, as not to ſubmit his ſpirit in a ſlaviſh manner to worſhip his will; ſhould be put to death, though in all other things he ſhould be faultleſſe. As therefore (I ſay) this in it ſelf is the higheſt point of Tyrannie; ſo in theſe times it may prove a moſt deceitfull policie, and hurtfull to this State to be practiſed; becauſe it is not alwayes a true mark of a Miniſter that is diſaffected, either to the State or the government thereof, to be unwilling to meddle with Acts of State in his pulpit; for I can by an infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony affirm the contrary in ſome whom I know: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well affected to the State as any can be, yet will be moſt averſe from this task: and that out of ſcrupuloſitie of conſcience, raiſed upon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations of the inexpediencie of the thing, towards the good of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:163962:94"/> State and government it ſelf, towards the Goſpel, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Miniſteriall function therein.</p>
                              <p>Now if a Miniſter ſhould onely upon ſuch grounds as theſe refuſe to be engaged in that practiſe, would it be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt in nature, or conſcionable towards God, or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the government, that a Magiſtrate ſhould diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, puniſh or diſcarde one of his beſt ſubjects from his moſt uſefull employment for ſuch a cauſe? I ſuppoſe no rationall man will think ſo. Therefore I ſhall conclude, that it would be every way more expedient, for the good both of Church and State, that this cuſtom were altered then continued: Yet I do not at all diſſwade the Magiſtrates publiſhing of his Acts in the Church, and at Church Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but I would not have it an engagement laid upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to do it, leſt it be done by his own officers. And thus I have done with the means and wayes of ſetting a foot, and entertaining a correſpondency between Magiſtrate and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: now remaineth the laſt point of this matter, which is concerning the obſtructions of this friendſhip, and how they may be removed.</p>

                                 <label>What the more ſpeciall and chief cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof are.</label> The immediate cauſes therfore of this obſtruction, which keeps off the one ſide (whom of all men it doth leaſt become to be irreconcilable) from a willingneſſe to be reconciled: are (as I ſuppoſe) the continuance of ſome ſtumbling blocks, which lye in their way; over which, they think it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to ſtep, to ſhake hands with thoſe that have layed them, till they be removed. And the main cauſes of ſtoppage, which keep off the other ſide, from coming neerer, or condeſcending to the chief deſires of the former partie; are partly the boiſterouſneſſe of their provoking carriages, and the deſtructiveneſſe of their deſires and principles to the ſafetie and conſtitution of the preſent State; which are things no wayes to be condeſcended unto, by thoſe that are in the poſſeſſion and truſt of power. On the one ſide, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed new frame and face of the publick profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with the conſequences thereof, apprehended to be ſet up by the Ruling Power, and upheld to the deſtruction of the preſent Miniſtery; is the main obſtacle of their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to yeeld to a concurrence in publick deſignes, leſt they ſhould ſeem to approve thereof: and on the other ſide, the ſuppoſed old frame and face of the publick government of the State, with the conſequences thereof, apprehended to be intended, and to be ſought after by the Miniſtery, to the deſtruction of the preſent Magiſtracie, is the main obſtacle of their willingneſſe to condeſcend unto the others deſires, leſt they ſhould yeeld to the means of their own overthrow. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe ſurmiſings and jealouſies on both ſides, oppoſite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes have been raiſed, and ſteps have been layed in each others wayes; to the hindrance of all friendly proceedings, and correſpondencie in every thing whatſoever, tending to the publick welfare, and to common ſafetie. It is fallen out through the unſearchable and juſt judgement of God over
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:163962:95"/> us, and over thoſe that have managed our affairs, that theſe blocks are fallen mutually in their wayes: ſo that they could not be prevented, nor avoided; but each of the parties dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in counſell, have fallen thereupon, and thereby upon each other, to the breach of friendſhip between them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and to the apparent threatning of their mutuall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the danger whereof is not as yet removed; but that now they ſhould be ſtill continued, and kept a foot by either ſide, is the hight of our preſent diſtreſſe, and the ſinfulneſſe of our calamitie. It is fatally unavoidable to men, to be of different judgements in the management of affairs, and to act thereupon by different deſignes, is a neceſſarie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereunto: but that they ſhould ſet themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively to oppoſe one another; is no neceſſarie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of different wayes, but onely an effect of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin" type="runSum">That the chief guilt of the evill thereof will lye upon thoſe that are not inclinable to the wayes of reconciliation.</note> of our ſpirit of envy: for when we cannot endure others, to be like and equall to our ſelves, in the proſecution of their own conveniencies, and to enjoy all the freedome which we deſire for our ſelves; then we become naturally their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, and caſt ſtumbling blocks in their way; but if when God in his righteouſneſſe doth overtake us, and cauſes us to fall by our own contrivances; ſo that the evill intended againſt others, becomes the portion of our own inheritance, by the evill ſucceſſe of our affairs; ſo that we cannot but ſee his hand lifted up againſt the way wherein we have ſet our ſelves If (I ſay) when God doth thus deal with us, we then ſtill continue rather to be obſtructive unto others, then edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying unto all in our deſignes; it is to be feared, that the ſtubbornneſſe of our envious diſpoſition, will make our caſe remediles. For if we turn not unto the Lord, to make ſtraight paths unto our feet, in his preſence, and to take reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtumbling blocks which proceed from each other out of one anothers way, it will be juſt with him to be avenged upon us both: as being therein manifeſtly the enemies of Chriſt, and of his kingdome, which now he is to ſet up more evidently in the world then heretofore. If therefore obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſtian friendſhip, through prejudices and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailties, are formerly fallen in amongſt us, and we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:163962:96"/> ſee they can tend to nothing but to ruine, we ought not to be ſo unconſcionably mad, as to foment them any longer: the time paſt may ſuffice us, to have been at a diſtance in profitable undertakings, and ſtrangers to one anothers counſels for the Goſpel; and it is more then enough, that envious ſurmiſes, and evil ſpeakings, with croſſe deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been entertained; let us henceforth purifie our hearts, and our hands from the guilt thereof, that we may have a joynt entrance, and become helpfull through love to one anothers furtherance, in the kingdome that is prepared for us; for we may confidently expect the enjoyment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if we be delivered from the clogs of theſe obſtructions. Whereſoever therefore any invincible ſtumbling blocks are ſtill continued, and whoſoever is the cauſe of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof henceforth, there, and upon that ſide the guilt of the obſtruction of Chriſtian love and correſpondencie, towards the building up of Chriſts kingdome will reſt: and whereſoever that guilt is found at his appearing, wo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that partie, whatſoever it hath been, or now is. And if both ſides at once, as in the heat of their oppoſition they have layed heretofore, ſhould ſtill continue (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) to lay ſuch ſtumbling blocks in each others way, as neither ſide can over-come, the guilt will be found a like in both. For although it may fall out, that the things differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently oppoſed and offenſive, by each to other, are not equall in weight, and a like of importance in themſelves; yet as to the intentions of thoſe that are at variance in point of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the guilt may be found equall; what the different weight is, of the oppoſite offenſive matters, tending to the obſtructing of the kingdome of Chriſt amongſt us (for that is the ſtandard by which God doth weigh all things) I ſhall not take upon me to judge or determine, (the day which cometh will make that manifeſt) nor is it needfull for any man, either of this or that ſide, ſo to do for a reconcilement of theſe differences; if on either ſide a Chriſtian healing be truely deſired. But if on any ſide no ſuch healing be deſired, nor ſought after, nor can be admitted; then juſtly all the guilt will reſt there alone, what ever the others
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:163962:96"/> fault may be, great or ſmall: for in Chriſtianity he is to be counted guiltleſſe (what ever otherwiſe his fault is) who ſincerely is willing, and ſeeks to make a reparation, in the preſence of Chriſt, to him whom he hath grieved: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſin will be found lying at his doore, who doth not at all mind either to give or receive ſuch a reparation as is poſſible and expedient to be given and received.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:163962:97"/> ſuch a Declaration, wherby an engagement may be brought upon them, to make them willing to liſten after ſome ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treatie, wherein both ſides may for conſcience ſake, in the fear of God intend to receive and give mutuall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo farre as may be, for things paſt; and to prevent the deſperate effects and miſchievous conſequences of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall increaſe of diſatisfaction in time to come. This ſhould be the maine deſigne of the Treatie; which none but an enemie unto all goodneſſe can diſreliſh: and none can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to obſtruct or divert, but ſuch as ſeek equally to have both parties deſtroyed by their own diviſions. For as to preſerve us from inevitable ruine, nothing is now neceſſary but our union in Chriſtianity; ſo to work our certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, nothing, as to men, hath a poſſibilitie to do it, but the continuance of our unchriſtian diviſions. Therefore I ſhall confidently hope, that if by the means of this kind of Mediation; ſome Regular and Prudently limited treatie with moderately free and peaceable conferences might be ſet a foot, to the end that between the godly on both ſides, ſome better intelligence may be begotten towards common Chriſtian deſignes; that between the Rationall, the diſcreet and the ingenuous of both ſides, ſome hurtfull miſtakes and prejudices may be rectified: and that between the fierceſt and moſt injuriouſly paſſionate on both ſides; ſome allaying of their heats may be wrought, and hatefull offenſiveneſſes made to ceaſe. I ſay, if a Treatie and conferences to this effect might be obtained; I am confident, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe black clouds which hang over us, and the darkneſſe of confuſion which doth beſet us, that the Sun of Righteouſneſſe would ſpeedily break forth, and gloriouſly ſhine upon us, with healing in his wings.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:163962:97"/> that it ſhould be between Miniſters of the one and the other ſide, to whom grave and judicious Common-wealths men of both parties might be joyned: not ſo much to debate, as to deliberate, and conſult of the manner and way of removing obſtructions, by the mutuall ſatisfaction of doubts and equitable deſires, of the one and the other ſide: to the end that henceforward a concurrence in neceſſary and pious endeavours may be ſetled amongſt thoſe that are truly Godly and faithfull in the Land.</p>
                              <p>And if it could be hoped, or probably known that this motion would be generally entertained; and a reall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation found on the one as well as on the other ſide, to meet together and ſpeak one with another about matters of agreement in a Rationall and Chriſtian way, it would be no difficult thing to propoſe upon liking a particular way and platform of proceeding, both for the Treatie and for the Conference; to ſhew how they might be ordered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partialitie, ſo as to reach without doubt to the ends for which they ſhould be ſet a foot: but till this can be hoped for, or known; it will be in vain to make any ſuch offer, eſpecially in a publick way: perhaps privately it will not be uſeleſſe to ſhew more fully theſe particulars. 1. For what Reaſons both ſides ſhould intend a Treatie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference one with another. 2. For what ends, and to what purpoſes the Treatie and Conference ſhould be ſet afoot. 3. What the way and means ſhould be to make them effectuall to their ends. Here again may be ſhewed. 1. How the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives thereof ſhould be made. 2. How the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein ſhould be ordered; both in the Treatie and in the Conference.</p>
                              <p>In the Treatie is to be thought upon. 1. Who ſhould be the treaters. 2. By whom choſen and appointed. 3. What their authority ſhould be. 4. How it ſhould be limited by thoſe that appoint them. 5. And what the Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſhould be in the meetings of each party amongſt themſelves apart; when they conſult with thoſe whom they ſhall appoint to treat publickly in their name.</p>
                              <p>In the Conferences is to be thought upon. 1. Who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:163962:98"/> ſhould be appointed to confer in the name of others. 2. How the conferences ſhould be managed; whether by extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary diſcourſes, or by putting things to paper; or both waies in certain caſes. 3. How the things whereof conferences are to be had, ſhould be determined; what ſhould be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in writing; what left unto extemporary diſcourſes at the meetings of both parties. 4. And whether each partie ſhould not exhibit unto the other in writing, what ever they amongſt themſelves fully agree in; that the other party may take it along with them to conſider of it, and to reply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to ſhew how far they conſent thereunto. 5. And to prevent miſtakes, whether the papers mutually exhibited to be conſidered, ſhould not be read; and in caſes of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in words explained and opened; and of doubts in the matters cleared, by the propoſall of Queſtions and Anſwers; which Scribes appointed on both ſides ſhould take notes of. 6. Whether any particular Treaters in caſes of doubts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſhould be intruſted to ſpeak the ſenſe of all <hi>ex tempore:</hi> and if not, how the matter ſhould be ordered, that all thoſe whoſe ſenſe is not declared, may be heard, and taken notice of without confuſion. I ſay concerning theſe, and ſuch like matters tending to prepare the way towards an agreement, perhaps it would not be amiſſe to have a preliminary Tract, which might be put into the hands of the Mediators of both ſides, that they might poſſeſſe thoſe with whom they ſhall deal on each ſide, with the platform of the whole deſigne; leſt any ſhould think themſelves over-reached, and brought into a ſnare; leſt jealouſies and ſiniſter impreſſions, of men that are prepoſſeſſed with fears of looſing their juſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, make the deſigne without effect. And leſt any ſhould be backward in ſo neceſſary a duty for want of inſight into that, which ought to be fore-known, and predetermined, that the means may be found anſwerable to the end, which ſhall be pretended, and intended.</p>
